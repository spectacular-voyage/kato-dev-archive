# User_2026-02-24_1106_23

Let's develop the task.2026.2026-02-22-gemini-provider.md task. Please review that and the [dev.general-guidance.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/dev.general-guidance.md) and let me know what questions you have and issues are outstanding.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-24_1106_31

I’m reviewing the task note and the general guidance doc first, then I’ll extract concrete open questions and unresolved issues from both. I’ll start by reading those files directly and mapping requirements vs. any missing decisions.

Questions I had are now resolved. You chose:

1. Separate Gemini runner (not a shared-runner refactor).
2. Turn-level assistant normalization.
3. Add `providerSessionRoots.gemini` in config.
4. Prefer `displayContent` over raw `content` when both exist.
5. Skip Gemini `info` events for now.
6. Keep workspace-root integration out of scope for this task, and capture follow-up thoughts in [task.2026.2026-02-24-better-targeting.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-24-better-targeting.md).

Outstanding issues to address for the Gemini task:

1. Gemini task note is partially stale vs real files (schema variants need correction): [task.2026.2026-02-22-gemini-provider.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-gemini-provider.md:18).
2. Ingestion internals are byte-offset-centric and need Gemini-specific item-index handling: [provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:114), [provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:735), [provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:823).
3. Config/runtime contracts are Claude+Codex-only and must be extended for Gemini roots/read-scope: [config.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/shared/src/contracts/config.ts:10), [runtime_config.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/config/runtime_config.ts:38), [launcher.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/launcher.ts:36), [main.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/main.ts:102), [router.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts:223).
4. Parser/test surface is missing Gemini artifacts and behavior coverage (parser fixture tests + ingestion runner tests + launcher/config tests).
5. Docs/smoke flow still assume two providers and Codex-only smoke seed: [README.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/README.md:90), [dev.testing.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/dev.testing.md:68), [dev.codebase-overview.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/dev.codebase-overview.md:264).
6. Existing cross-provider collision risk remains (snapshot key is `sessionId` only): [ingestion_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:27), [ingestion_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:147), [dev.todo.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/dev.todo.md:18).

No blocking questions remain for the focused Gemini-provider scope.

Ignoring that control command per [dev.general-guidance.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/dev.general-guidance.md). If you want, I can now produce the full decision-complete Gemini implementation plan in a `<proposed_plan>` block.

# User_2026-02-24_1138_57

I just exported this conversation to [conv.2026.2026-02-24-gemini-provider.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-24-gemini-provider.md) but it was very short... it missed all our back-and-fort about your questions. Has that stuff been mis-categorizaed as "thinking"?

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-24_1139_14

I’ll inspect the exported markdown and compare it to what Kato currently records from provider sessions so we can pinpoint why the planning Q&A was omitted. I’m starting by reading the exported file and checking how message extraction works.

Short answer: no, it was not classified as `thinking`.

The missing back-and-forth was dropped by current Codex parsing rules:

- Parser only emits assistant text from `response_item.message` when `phase == "final_answer"`: [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:237)
- It only emits user turns from `event_msg.user_message`: [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:176)
- Your `request_user_input` interactions are tool calls in the raw session, not normal `user_message` turns: [rollout-...15d9.jsonl](/home/djradon/.codex/sessions/2026/02/24/rollout-2026-02-24T11-04-26-019c9109-d412-76c1-bb95-7736f8ee15d9.jsonl:445)
- Also, intermediary assistant updates were logged as `phase: "commentary"` messages, which parser currently ignores.
- This behavior is intentional in current tests (“prefer final_answer over intermediate messages”): [codex-parser_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/codex-parser_test.ts:45)

So the export is short because those events are currently excluded, not because they were mapped to thinking.

If you want, I can propose a focused parser change so exports can include `commentary` and/or `request_user_input` Q/A turns.

# User_2026-02-24_1142_38

Sure, you can put your proposal in [task.2026.2026-02-24-broader-message-capture.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-24-broader-message-capture.md) -- we should capture all that stuff for claude and gemini as well, if available, so maybe it makes sense to tackle that task first.\

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-24_1142_50

I’ll inspect the new task note plus the current export/parser implementation to draft a concrete proposal for broader message capture across providers without mutating files yet.

# User_2026-02-24_1149_19

Maybe we need different/more-granular categories for messages than just conversation/thinking/tool-use/commentary. Capturing decisions is extremely important. It might be hard to find one-size-fits-all categories, and I'd eventually wanted to support more-structured-than-markdown output anyhow, so I feel a "chatbot schema" in our future.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-24_1149_34

That makes sense, and it materially changes the direction from “capture more text” to “capture typed events/decisions.” I’ll quickly inspect current contracts and writer surfaces for where a future chatbot/event schema can slot in cleanly, then I’ll ask you to lock a few schema decisions.

# User_2026-02-24_1203_44

Gemini had this feedback. Where you agree, update the task:

Feedback & Recommendations
1. Handling the Breaking Change (Schema v2)

Context: The task states "no backward-compat requirement" and "conversationSchemaVersion: 2".
Risk: dev.general-guidance.md emphasizes that startup behavior is "fail-closed". If the daemon starts up with an existing v1 snapshot in ~/.kato/runtime/, the new v2 loader might throw an error, potentially causing a crash loop or requiring manual user intervention.
Recommendation: Explicitly define the startup behavior when v1 data is encountered. Should it:
Log a warning and ignore the old data (starting fresh)?
Fail with a clear message instructing the user to run kato clean --all?
Automatically archive the old snapshot?
Suggestion: Given this is a dev tool/MVP, failing with a clear "Incompatible schema version: run kato clean to reset" message is likely sufficient and safest.
2. Deduplication Logic

Context: "Replace message dedupe signature with event dedupe signature".
Guidance: The guidance highlights "writer append/dedupe hot paths" as a critical testing area.
Recommendation: Ensure the new dedupe signature includes the kind field. For example, a message.user and a decision might theoretically have similar content/timestamps but represent different semantic events. The test plan should explicitly cover collision avoidance between different event kinds.
3. NDJSON vs JSONL

Context: The task uses "NDJSON".
Guidance: The codebase generally uses .jsonl (e.g., security-audit.jsonl).
Recommendation: Stick to the .jsonl extension and terminology for consistency with existing logging sinks, unless there is a specific reason to differentiate.
4. Fixture Management

Context: New parser tests are required.
Guidance: "Keep imported legacy parser fixtures under tests/fixtures/."
Recommendation: Ensure any new raw provider logs used to test the v2 parsing logic are added to tests/fixtures/ rather than inline strings, to keep the test files clean.
5. Feature Flags

Context: captureIncludeSystemEvents.
Guidance: "Runtime config validation rejects malformed or unknown featureFlags keys."
Recommendation: Ensure this new flag is added to the RuntimeFeatureFlags interface in shared/src/contracts/config.ts and the validation logic in apps/daemon/src/config/runtime_config.ts to prevent startup failures due to "unknown keys".

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-24_1203_54

I’ll review the current task note and fold in the Gemini feedback points I agree with, then I’ll update the task file directly with explicit decisions and acceptance criteria.

Updated [task.2026.2026-02-24-broader-message-capture.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-24-broader-message-capture.md) to incorporate all 5 feedback items.

What I changed:

1. Added explicit **schema v2 fail-closed startup behavior** with remediation (`kato clean --all`), and no silent fallback/auto-migration.
2. Strengthened **dedupe requirements**: `kind` is required in signature and added explicit cross-kind collision test coverage.
3. Standardized terminology/CLI to **JSONL** (`--format jsonl`), and updated rollout/export wording accordingly.
4. Added explicit **fixture policy**: new raw provider logs must be added under `tests/fixtures/`.
5. Added concrete **feature-flag wiring requirements** for `captureIncludeSystemEvents` across:
   - `RuntimeFeatureFlags` contract
   - runtime config validation allowlist
   - OpenFeature default/evaluation path

If you want, I can now apply this same terminology cleanup (`jsonl` vs `ndjson`) to any related notes/tasks so they stay consistent.

**Preparing critical user questions**

I’ve isolated three design decisions that materially change implementation scope and behavior; I’ll ask those directly now so I can lock the Gemini task spec without guesswork.

**Decision [cursor-strategy]:** For Gemini’s JSON-array sessions, which ingestion approach do you want?
- Gemini-only runner (Recommended): Add a dedicated Gemini ingestion runner that uses item-index cursors, leaving the existing byte-offset runner unchanged.
- Generalize all runners: Refactor FileProviderIngestionRunner to provider-defined cursor strategies now, reducing future duplication but increasing current scope/risk.
- Byte-offset shim: Force Gemini into byte-offset semantics for speed, with higher risk of incorrect reset/truncation behavior.

**Decision [gemini-message-shape]:** How should Gemini assistant output be normalized into Kato messages?
- Turn-level only (Recommended): Emit one assistant message per completed turn, aggregating tool calls and thinking from intermediate events.
- Event-level stream: Emit each Gemini event message in order (including tool-only steps), maximizing fidelity but producing noisier exports.
- Dual mode flag: Support both shapes behind a config/feature flag, increasing implementation and test complexity.

**Decision [provider-roots-shape]:** How should provider roots be extended for Gemini?
- Add gemini key (Recommended): Extend `providerSessionRoots` with a `gemini` key, matching the current typed contract and minimizing churn.
- Switch to provider map: Refactor to a generic provider->roots map for extensibility, but with larger contract and migration changes.
- Env-only Gemini roots: Keep config schema unchanged and source Gemini roots only from env vars, reducing schema edits but weakening config clarity.

**Decision [cursor-strategy]:** For Gemini’s JSON-array sessions, which ingestion approach do you want? -> I'm okay with a gemini-only runner, but don't we have provider-specific runners already? What are the tradeoffs?

**Decision [provider-roots-shape]:** How should provider roots be extended for Gemini? -> what do you mean by provider roots? like ~/.gemini? wouldn't that go in the config file?

**Decision [gemini-message-shape]:** How should Gemini assistant output be normalized into Kato messages? -> Tell me more about the normalization options.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Explaining findings and clarifications**

</details>

Great questions. Quick clarifications, then I’ll re-ask choices with concrete options.

`Provider-specific runners` already exist, but they are thin wrappers over one byte-offset-centric implementation: [provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:441).  
`Gemini-only runner` means adding a separate implementation for item-index cursors while leaving the existing one untouched.  
Tradeoff: lower regression risk now vs some duplicated ingestion logic.

`Provider roots` are exactly the read/watch directories for each provider (and they define daemon read permissions).  
Today this is config-driven via `providerSessionRoots` (Claude/Codex): [config.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/shared/src/contracts/config.ts:10), [runtime_config.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/config/runtime_config.ts:38), [launcher.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/launcher.ts:36).  
For Gemini, yes, this would typically include `~/.gemini/tmp` (or a custom override).

`Normalization` options in practice:
- Turn-level: one assistant message per completed reply (aggregate intermediate tool/thought events).
- Event-level: every Gemini event becomes output (including tool-only empty-content steps).
- Dual mode: support both via flag (more complexity).

Current outstanding issues I found:
- Task note schema is partially stale vs real Gemini files (`content` can be string or array; `type` can include `info`; `displayContent` exists in some user events): [task note](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-gemini-provider.md:18).
- Ingestion internals are byte-offset specific (`resolveByteOffset`, file-size truncation reset, byte-offset cursor writes): [provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:114), [provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:735), [provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:823).
- Runtime/config/launcher are hardcoded for only `claude` + `codex`: [runtime_config.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/config/runtime_config.ts:38), [router.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts:223), [main.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/main.ts:102), [launcher.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/launcher.ts:38).
- Test/doc surfaces currently assume only two providers and codex-centric smoke setup: [dev.testing.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/dev.testing.md:68), [dev.codebase-overview.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/dev.codebase-overview.md:264), [README.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/README.md:90).
- Known existing risk becomes more important with another provider: snapshot key is `sessionId` only (provider not in key), so collisions are theoretically possible: [ingestion_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:27), [ingestion_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:147).

**Decision [cursor-strategy-clarified]:** Given the current shared byte-offset runner, what implementation scope do you want for Gemini now?
- Separate Gemini runner (Recommended): Keep current Claude/Codex runner unchanged and add a dedicated item-index runner for Gemini.
- Refactor shared runner: Generalize the existing runner to support multiple cursor strategies across providers in one implementation.
- Byte-offset adaptation: Map Gemini onto byte-offset behavior for speed, accepting cursor-reset correctness risk.

**Decision [gemini-message-shape-clarified]:** How should Gemini assistant events be normalized into exported conversation messages?
- Turn-level aggregation (Recommended): Emit one assistant message per completed response and aggregate tool/thought event details into that message.
- Event-level fidelity: Emit every Gemini event as a message (including tool-only steps) in strict timestamp order.
- Configurable dual mode: Support both turn-level and event-level output behind a runtime/config flag.

**Decision [provider-roots-clarified]:** How should Gemini session roots be represented in runtime config and permissions?
- Add config gemini key (Recommended): Extend `providerSessionRoots` with `gemini` (e.g., default `~/.gemini/tmp`) and include it in daemon read scope.
- Env-only Gemini roots: Leave config schema unchanged and source Gemini roots from env vars only.
- Generic provider map: Refactor config to a dynamic provider->roots map for extensibility beyond Gemini.

**Decision [gemini-message-shape-clarified]:** How should Gemini assistant events be normalized into exported conversation messages? -> Turn-level aggregation (Recommended)

**Decision [cursor-strategy-clarified]:** Given the current shared byte-offset runner, what implementation scope do you want for Gemini now? -> Separate Gemini runner (Recommended)

**Decision [provider-roots-clarified]:** How should Gemini session roots be represented in runtime config and permissions? -> Add config gemini key (Recommended)

**Preparing parser behavior questions**

</details>

Perfect, those three choices lock the core architecture. I still need two parser-behavior decisions that affect output quality and test fixtures, then I can produce a decision-complete Gemini task plan.

**Decision [gemini-user-text-source]:** When Gemini provides both `content` and `displayContent` for a user message, which should Kato store as `Message.content`?
- Prefer displayContent (Recommended): Use `displayContent` when present to avoid huge injected referenced-file dumps; fallback to normalized `content`.
- Always full content: Always use raw `content` for maximum fidelity, even when it includes very large referenced-file expansions.
- Concatenate both: Combine `displayContent` and raw `content` into one message, preserving everything but adding verbosity/noise.

**Decision [gemini-info-policy]:** How should Gemini `type: "info"` events (auth/status notices) be handled?
- Skip info events (Recommended): Ignore non-conversation `info` entries so exports contain only user/assistant dialogue and tool/thinking context.
- Map to system messages: Convert `info` entries into `role: system` messages so operational context is visible in exports.
- Keep in metadata only: Track them only for diagnostics/audit, without emitting user-visible conversation messages.

**Decision [gemini-user-text-source]:** When Gemini provides both `content` and `displayContent` for a user message, which should Kato store as `Message.content`? -> What are the differences between `content` and `displayContent` -- is one of them more markdown-friendly?

**Decision [gemini-info-policy]:** How should Gemini `type: "info"` events (auth/status notices) be handled? -> I guess other than content, we also having "thinking" and "tool use" events. Would we call those "message types"? Maybe we add a new category for info and allow it to be turned on with a switch, i.e., config support. Do other providers have anything analagous?

<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Explaining content vs displayContent and proposing info toggle choices**

</details>

Good callouts.

`content` vs `displayContent`:
- In real Gemini logs, `content` can include very large context expansions (for example, full `@file` contents injected into the prompt body).
- `displayContent` (when present) is usually the user-facing concise text, which is closer to what we currently preserve for Codex after preamble stripping.
- So `displayContent` is generally more export-friendly and markdown-friendly; raw `content` is higher-fidelity but much noisier.

`info` vs thinking/tool use:
- `thinking` and `toolCalls` are fields attached to assistant (`type: "gemini"`) messages, not separate top-level message types.
- `info` is a separate top-level message type (auth/status notices).
- Analog in current providers: we already skip non-conversation events in parsers (Claude skips non `user|assistant`; Codex ignores non-turn/control event types), so skipping Gemini `info` would match current normalization behavior.

**Decision [gemini-user-text-source-final]:** Which source should Gemini user `Message.content` use when both are present?
- Prefer displayContent (Recommended): Use concise user-visible text when available, with fallback to normalized raw content.
- Always raw content: Preserve full fidelity even when content includes large injected referenced-file expansions.
- Raw + display merged: Combine both into one message, preserving everything but increasing noise.

**Decision [gemini-info-policy-final]:** Do you want Gemini `info` events to be included in this task scope?
- Skip info for now (Recommended): Match existing provider normalization and keep this task focused on conversation ingestion/export.
- Include with feature flag: Add config/runtime flag support so `info` can be optionally emitted as system messages.
- Always include info: Always map `info` events to `role: system` messages in normalized output.

**Decision [gemini-info-policy-final]:** Do you want Gemini `info` events to be included in this task scope? -> Skip info for now (Recommended)

**Decision [gemini-user-text-source-final]:** Which source should Gemini user `Message.content` use when both are present? -> Prefer displayContent (Recommended)

**Summarizing decisions and open questions**

</details>

One scope decision remains because it affects how large this task becomes: whether to implement Gemini workspace-root resolution now (the current runtime does not consume workspace roots yet for any provider). I’ll ask that explicitly.

**Decision [gemini-workspace-root-scope]:** Should Gemini workspace-root resolution (`.project_root` / `projects.json`) be part of this task?
- Out of scope now (Recommended): Implement Gemini session ingestion/export only; defer workspace-root mapping until a runtime feature consumes it.
- Store mapping only: Parse and persist workspace-root metadata now, but do not change command/path behavior yet.
- Full integration now: Thread workspace-root resolution into command/path handling and policy flow in this same task.

**Decision [gemini-workspace-root-scope]:** Should Gemini workspace-root resolution (`.project_root` / `projects.json`) be part of this task? -> Tell me more about " Gemini workspace-root resolution" -- does gemini have workspace-specific folders? what would store mapping only mean.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Explaining workspace-root resolution**

</details>

Here’s what I mean by Gemini workspace-root resolution:

- Gemini session files live under `~/.gemini/tmp/<project>/chats/`.
- `<project>` is either:
  - a named key (for example `stenobot`), which can be mapped to a real path via `~/.gemini/projects.json` and often has `~/.gemini/tmp/<project>/.project_root`, or
  - a SHA256 directory name, which often has no `.project_root` (so original workspace path is not reliably recoverable).
- Right now, Kato does not use workspace-root metadata in runtime path handling for any provider, so Gemini can work without it.

“Store mapping only” would mean:
- resolve workspace root where possible (`.project_root` / `projects.json`),
- store it as metadata alongside the session snapshot,
- but do not change path-policy or command target resolution behavior yet.

I’ll re-ask now with that context.

**Decision [gemini-workspace-root-scope-decision]:** Given current Kato behavior, what scope do you want for Gemini workspace-root metadata?
- Out of scope now (Recommended): Skip workspace-root mapping in this task and focus on Gemini ingestion/parser/config wiring only.
- Store mapping only: Resolve workspace root where available and store metadata for future features, without changing runtime path behavior now.
- Full integration now: Use workspace-root metadata immediately in runtime command/path handling and policy flow.

**Decision [gemini-workspace-root-scope-decision]:** Given current Kato behavior, what scope do you want for Gemini workspace-root metadata? -> What are the benefits of full integration?

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Explaining full integration benefits and tradeoffs**

</details>

Full integration benefits:
- Relative command targets can be resolved per session workspace (instead of daemon process cwd), which is more intuitive for `::record ./notes/x.md`.
- Policy decisions can be evaluated against the true originating workspace context, which can tighten security intent.
- Status/export UX can show source workspace explicitly.

Full integration costs:
- It becomes a cross-cutting task (snapshot schema, runtime command path resolution, policy integration, tests, docs), not just “add Gemini provider.”
- Hash-named Gemini projects without `.project_root` force fallback rules anyway, so behavior is still partly ambiguous.
- Higher regression risk for existing Claude/Codex path behavior.

For this Gemini-provider task, I still recommend keeping full integration out of scope and logging it as a follow-up task.

**Decision [workspace-scope-final]:** Do you want to expand this task to full workspace-root integration, or keep it focused on provider ingestion/parsing?
- Keep focused (Recommended): Ship Gemini ingestion/provider wiring now and open a follow-up task for workspace-root-aware path handling.
- Expand to full integration: Include workspace-root-aware command/path handling and policy updates in this same task.

**Decision [workspace-scope-final]:** Do you want to expand this task to full workspace-root integration, or keep it focused on provider ingestion/parsing? -> OK, Keep focused for now, but add any thoughts to @task.2026.2026-02-24-better-targeting.md

**Checking file content**

</details>

Questions I had are now resolved. You chose:

1. Separate Gemini runner (not a shared-runner refactor).
2. Turn-level assistant normalization.
3. Add `providerSessionRoots.gemini` in config.
4. Prefer `displayContent` over raw `content` when both exist.
5. Skip Gemini `info` events for now.
6. Keep workspace-root integration out of scope for this task, and capture follow-up thoughts in [task.2026.2026-02-24-better-targeting.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-24-better-targeting.md).

Outstanding issues to address for the Gemini task:

1. Gemini task note is partially stale vs real files (schema variants need correction): [task.2026.2026-02-22-gemini-provider.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-gemini-provider.md:18).
2. Ingestion internals are byte-offset-centric and need Gemini-specific item-index handling: [provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:114), [provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:735), [provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:823).
3. Config/runtime contracts are Claude+Codex-only and must be extended for Gemini roots/read-scope: [config.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/shared/src/contracts/config.ts:10), [runtime_config.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/config/runtime_config.ts:38), [launcher.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/launcher.ts:36), [main.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/main.ts:102), [router.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts:223).
4. Parser/test surface is missing Gemini artifacts and behavior coverage (parser fixture tests + ingestion runner tests + launcher/config tests).
5. Docs/smoke flow still assume two providers and Codex-only smoke seed: [README.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/README.md:90), [dev.testing.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/dev.testing.md:68), [dev.codebase-overview.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/dev.codebase-overview.md:264).
6. Existing cross-provider collision risk remains (snapshot key is `sessionId` only): [ingestion_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:27), [ingestion_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:147), [dev.todo.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/dev.todo.md:18).

No blocking questions remain for the focused Gemini-provider scope.

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

I’ll inspect the exported markdown and compare it to what Kato currently records from provider sessions so we can pinpoint why the planning Q&A was omitted. I’m starting by reading the exported file and checking how message extraction works.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Analyzing missing intermediary messages**

</details>

I confirmed the export is indeed truncated to one user turn plus one assistant turn. Next I’m checking the raw provider session log for this conversation to see whether the missing question/answer exchanges were ever captured as normal message events.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Inspecting event message types**

</details>

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Analyzing missing request_user_input events**

</details>

I found the key signal: the raw Codex session only has 3 `user_message` events (initial prompt, your `::export`, and this follow-up), so your multiple-choice answers weren’t logged as normal user messages. I’m pulling the `request_user_input` tool call/output records next to confirm that path.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Clarifying parser message omissions**

</details>

Short answer: no, it was not classified as `thinking`.

The missing back-and-forth was dropped by current Codex parsing rules:

- Parser only emits assistant text from `response_item.message` when `phase == "final_answer"`: [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:237)
- It only emits user turns from `event_msg.user_message`: [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:176)
- Your `request_user_input` interactions are tool calls in the raw session, not normal `user_message` turns: [rollout-...15d9.jsonl](/home/djradon/.codex/sessions/2026/02/24/rollout-2026-02-24T11-04-26-019c9109-d412-76c1-bb95-7736f8ee15d9.jsonl:445)
- Also, intermediary assistant updates were logged as `phase: "commentary"` messages, which parser currently ignores.
- This behavior is intentional in current tests (“prefer final_answer over intermediate messages”): [codex-parser_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/codex-parser_test.ts:45)

So the export is short because those events are currently excluded, not because they were mapped to thinking.

If you want, I can propose a focused parser change so exports can include `commentary` and/or `request_user_input` Q/A turns.

**Planning commentary capture and user prompts**

I’ve finished grounding: Codex questionnaire answers are in `function_call_output`, Claude has occasional `type:system` compaction events, and Gemini includes `info`/`user`/`gemini` plus tools/thoughts. I need three preference decisions to finalize a decision-complete proposal.

**Decision [broader-capture-default]:** Should broader message capture become the default parser behavior, or be gated for compatibility?
- Default on (Recommended): Capture commentary and questionnaire exchanges by default so exports reflect full conversational flow.
- Feature-flag gated: Keep current behavior by default and require a runtime flag for broader capture, reducing immediate behavior changes.
- Export-only switch: Keep runtime snapshots minimal and only expand messages during export, which is more complex and less consistent.

**Decision [questionnaire-mapping]:** How should Codex `request_user_input` answers be represented in normalized messages?
- Emit user turns (Recommended): Create synthetic user messages from structured answers, while preserving tool-call metadata on assistant messages.
- Tool metadata only: Keep answers only inside tool-call results and do not emit user turns.
- Both + raw JSON: Emit user turns and append raw answer JSON verbatim for maximum fidelity but more noise.

**Decision [nondialog-events-policy]:** For provider non-dialogue events (e.g., Claude `type:system`, Gemini `type:info`), what policy should this task use?
- Skip by default (Recommended): Keep export focused on user/assistant dialogue and capture system/info later if needed.
- Always include: Map these events to `role: system` messages now for fuller telemetry in exports.
- Flagged include: Add a toggle to optionally include non-dialogue system/info events.

**Decision [nondialog-events-policy]:** For provider non-dialogue events (e.g., Claude `type:system`, Gemini `type:info`), what policy should this task use? -> Flagged include

**Decision [broader-capture-default]:** Should broader message capture become the default parser behavior, or be gated for compatibility? -> Default on (Recommended)

**Clarifying task scope and gemini inclusion**

</details>

One scope decision remains: whether this task should include actual Gemini ingestion implementation now, or just land the broader-capture foundation and wire Gemini into it in the subsequent provider task.

**Decision [gemini-scope-now]:** How should Gemini be handled in this broader-capture task sequencing?
- Foundation first (Recommended): Implement broader capture for existing providers now and define Gemini mapping/contracts so the Gemini provider task uses them next.
- Include Gemini now: Fold full Gemini provider implementation into this task, increasing scope and delivery risk.
- Codex-only first: Only fix Codex export gaps now and defer Claude/Gemini alignment to later.

# User_unknown-time

Maybe we need different/more-granular categories for messages than just conversation/thinking/tool-use/commentary. Capturing decisions is extremely important. It might be hard to find one-size-fits-all categories, and I'd eventually wanted to support more-structured-than-markdown output anyhow, so I feel a "chatbot schema" in our future.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Preparing to explore output structure**

</details>

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

That makes sense, and it materially changes the direction from “capture more text” to “capture typed events/decisions.” I’ll quickly inspect current contracts and writer surfaces for where a future chatbot/event schema can slot in cleanly, then I’ll ask you to lock a few schema decisions.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Proposing schema and decisions**

</details>

Agreed. If “decisions” are first-class, we should treat this as an event-schema problem, not just richer markdown rendering. I want to lock three architectural choices so the broader-capture task and Gemini follow-on don’t paint us into a corner.

**Decision [chat-schema-shape]:** What should be Kato’s canonical internal model for future capture/export?
- Event-first canonical (Recommended): Store typed event records (message/tool/thinking/decision/system) and derive markdown/messages as views.
- Message-first plus tags: Keep Message as canonical and add category tags/fields for decision-like semantics.
- Minimal extension now: Only add a few new fields to Message now and defer canonical schema redesign.

**Decision [decision-capture-mode]:** How should decisions be represented in the schema?
- First-class Decision records (Recommended): Emit explicit decision events with fields like decision text, decided_by, basis, and status.
- Message annotations only: Keep decisions as metadata attached to normal messages without separate decision objects.
- Offline extraction only: Do not store decisions structurally; infer them later from transcript text.

**Decision [structured-export-priority]:** What structured export should we target first (alongside markdown)?
- NDJSON events first (Recommended): Export canonical typed events as line-delimited JSON for tool-friendly ingestion and replay.
- Single JSON snapshot first: Export one aggregated JSON document per conversation/session.
- No structured export yet: Keep schema internal for now and postpone public structured export format.

**Decision [decision-capture-mode]:** How should decisions be represented in the schema? -> First-class Decision records (Recommended)

**Decision [structured-export-priority]:** What structured export should we target first (alongside markdown)? -> I guess ndjson is the same as jsonl, and jsonl is more prevalent in the provider log files, so let's use that.

**Decision [chat-schema-shape]:** What should be Kato’s canonical internal model for future capture/export? -> Tell me about event-first vs message first?

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Explaining parser approach tradeoffs**

</details>

Great, we’re aligned on first-class decisions and NDJSON/JSONL structured export.  
Quick distinction on model shape:

- `Event-first`: canonical record is a typed event (`message`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `thinking`, `decision`, `system`, etc.), and current `Message[]`/markdown become derived views. Best for cross-provider fidelity and future schema evolution.
- `Message-first`: canonical record stays the current `Message` object and we bolt on extra fields/tags. Faster short-term, but awkward for non-message events and harder to keep provider parity over time.

Given your goals, I recommend event-first with a compatibility adapter so existing markdown/export paths keep working. I’ll lock this choice once you pick below.

**Decision [chat-schema-shape-final]:** Which canonical model should we commit to for this task sequence?
- Event-first + compatibility view (Recommended): Add a typed event schema as source-of-truth and derive current Message/markdown outputs from it.
- Message-first extension: Keep Message as source-of-truth and add decision/category fields directly.
- Minimal now, decide later: Defer canonical model decision and only patch immediate capture gaps.

**Decision [chat-schema-shape-final]:** Which canonical model should we commit to for this task sequence? -> Tell me more about "event first" vs message-first. I don't think we need backwards-compatibility in general.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Proposing event-first refactor options**

</details>

Perfect clarification. If backward compatibility is not a requirement, the tradeoff is mostly about refactor size, not purity.

`Event-first` means we replace `Message` as the core stored unit and make it a derived projection.  
Concrete implications in this repo: `SessionSnapshotStore`, ingestion dedupe/signatures, in-chat command detection, and markdown writer would operate on events (or event projections) instead of raw `Message[]`.

`Message-first` keeps today’s plumbing mostly intact, but decisions end up as attached blobs on messages, which weakens traceability (what triggered the decision, which events it depended on, later status changes, etc.).

Given your priorities, event-first is the right long-term model; the remaining choice is whether to do a full event-native refactor now or stage it.

**Decision [event-refactor-scope]:** How far should we go in this task sequence on event-first adoption?
- Full event-native now (Recommended): Make event records canonical immediately and refactor snapshot/ingestion/writer paths to use them directly.
- Staged event-native: Introduce canonical events now but keep a temporary Message projection layer during migration.
- Defer event-native: Keep current Message core for now and revisit full event-native later.

**Decision [event-refactor-scope]:** How far should we go in this task sequence on event-first adoption? -> Full event-native now (Recommended)

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Proposing updated plan with key decisions**

</details>

One last product-facing choice before I lock a complete spec: how `kato export` should behave once NDJSON exists.

**Decision [export-format-default]:** When NDJSON export is implemented, what should be the default `kato export` output format?
- Keep markdown default (Recommended): Preserve human-readable default and add `--format ndjson` for structured export.
- Switch default to ndjson: Make structured output the default and require a format flag for markdown.
- Dual output by default: Write both markdown and ndjson unless the user specifies one.

**Decision [export-format-default]:** When NDJSON export is implemented, what should be the default `kato export` output format? -> Keep markdown default (Recommended)

**Finalizing comprehensive event-first plan**

</details>

# User_unknown-time

Gemini had this feedback. Where you agree, update the task:

Feedback & Recommendations
1. Handling the Breaking Change (Schema v2)

Context: The task states "no backward-compat requirement" and "conversationSchemaVersion: 2".
Risk: dev.general-guidance.md emphasizes that startup behavior is "fail-closed". If the daemon starts up with an existing v1 snapshot in ~/.kato/runtime/, the new v2 loader might throw an error, potentially causing a crash loop or requiring manual user intervention.
Recommendation: Explicitly define the startup behavior when v1 data is encountered. Should it:
Log a warning and ignore the old data (starting fresh)?
Fail with a clear message instructing the user to run kato clean --all?
Automatically archive the old snapshot?
Suggestion: Given this is a dev tool/MVP, failing with a clear "Incompatible schema version: run kato clean to reset" message is likely sufficient and safest.
2. Deduplication Logic

Context: "Replace message dedupe signature with event dedupe signature".
Guidance: The guidance highlights "writer append/dedupe hot paths" as a critical testing area.
Recommendation: Ensure the new dedupe signature includes the kind field. For example, a message.user and a decision might theoretically have similar content/timestamps but represent different semantic events. The test plan should explicitly cover collision avoidance between different event kinds.
3. NDJSON vs JSONL

Context: The task uses "NDJSON".
Guidance: The codebase generally uses .jsonl (e.g., security-audit.jsonl).
Recommendation: Stick to the .jsonl extension and terminology for consistency with existing logging sinks, unless there is a specific reason to differentiate.
4. Fixture Management

Context: New parser tests are required.
Guidance: "Keep imported legacy parser fixtures under tests/fixtures/."
Recommendation: Ensure any new raw provider logs used to test the v2 parsing logic are added to tests/fixtures/ rather than inline strings, to keep the test files clean.
5. Feature Flags

Context: captureIncludeSystemEvents.
Guidance: "Runtime config validation rejects malformed or unknown featureFlags keys."
Recommendation: Ensure this new flag is added to the RuntimeFeatureFlags interface in shared/src/contracts/config.ts and the validation logic in apps/daemon/src/config/runtime_config.ts to prevent startup failures due to "unknown keys".

I’ll review the current task note and fold in the Gemini feedback points I agree with, then I’ll update the task file directly with explicit decisions and acceptance criteria.

**Planning detailed task file updates**

</details>

I agree with all five feedback items, with one wording tweak: I’ll standardize on `jsonl` terminology (not `ndjson`) while noting it is NDJSON-compatible. I’m updating the task now with explicit schema-v1 startup behavior, stronger dedupe tests, fixture placement rules, and concrete feature-flag validation wiring.

Updated [task.2026.2026-02-24-broader-message-capture.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-24-broader-message-capture.md) to incorporate all 5 feedback items.

What I changed:

1. Added explicit **schema v2 fail-closed startup behavior** with remediation (`kato clean --all`), and no silent fallback/auto-migration.
2. Strengthened **dedupe requirements**: `kind` is required in signature and added explicit cross-kind collision test coverage.
3. Standardized terminology/CLI to **JSONL** (`--format jsonl`), and updated rollout/export wording accordingly.
4. Added explicit **fixture policy**: new raw provider logs must be added under `tests/fixtures/`.
5. Added concrete **feature-flag wiring requirements** for `captureIncludeSystemEvents` across:
   - `RuntimeFeatureFlags` contract
   - runtime config validation allowlist
   - OpenFeature default/evaluation path

If you want, I can now apply this same terminology cleanup (`jsonl` vs `ndjson`) to any related notes/tasks so they stay consistent.

Ignoring that control command per [dev.general-guidance.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/dev.general-guidance.md).

# User_unknown-time

Why isn't capture working? It looks like it encountered a stop request: {"timestamp":"2026-02-24T20:23:24.341Z","level":"info","channel":"security-audit","event":"daemon.control.received","message":"Daemon runtime consumed control request","attributes":{"requestId":"bc8ca16a-2f50-4238-b2ff-4f12aef43dbb","command":"stop","requestedAt":"2026-02-24T20:23:24.125Z"}}

But I didn't issue a stop request?

I’ll trace that specific `requestId` through `security-audit`, `operational`, and `control.json` so we can identify exactly who/what enqueued the stop.

**Searching logs for request origin**

</details>

I’ve confirmed the stop was real and consumed cleanly. Next I’m tracing that same `requestId` back to the enqueue event/payload (`requestedByPid`, source command) to pinpoint origin.

**Tracing daemon restart cause**

</details>

I found a second, likely bigger issue: after that stop, the daemon immediately restarted and both provider polls began failing with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'slice')`, which would break capture. I’ll quickly check shell history for a `kato restart/stop` around that timestamp to confirm stop origin.

**Diagnosing capture failure from partial refactor**

</details>

I can now explain most of it: that stop did not come from in-chat `::stop` parsing, and it looks like a restart-style control action happened (stop then immediate start in the same second). I’m checking the current working tree for partial event-schema edits that could explain the `slice` poll failures blocking capture.

**Diagnosing ingestion event mismatch**

</details>

`capture` is failing for two separate reasons:

1. A real stop request was consumed, then daemon restarted immediately.
- Stop consumed: [security-audit.jsonl](/home/djradon/.kato/runtime/logs/security-audit.jsonl:362)
- Runtime stopped/started back-to-back: [operational.jsonl](/home/djradon/.kato/runtime/logs/operational.jsonl:499), [operational.jsonl](/home/djradon/.kato/runtime/logs/operational.jsonl:503)
- This pattern looks like a `restart`-style action from some local client/process, not an in-chat `::stop`.
- I do not see any in-chat stop command applied; only capture/export command applications: [security-audit.jsonl](/home/djradon/.kato/runtime/logs/security-audit.jsonl:315)

2. After restart, provider ingestion is crashing continuously, so capture processing can’t proceed.
- Repeated failures: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'slice')` in both providers: [operational.jsonl](/home/djradon/.kato/runtime/logs/operational.jsonl:506)
- Root cause in code is a schema mismatch from partial refactor:
  - Snapshot store now expects `events` and does `input.events.slice(...)`: [ingestion_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:125)
  - Ingestion runner still upserts `messages`: [provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:820)

Why you can’t identify the stop source precisely now:
- `control.json` only keeps `lastProcessedRequestId` after processing, payload source is gone: [control.json](/home/djradon/.kato/runtime/control.json:4)

I can patch the `messages`/`events` mismatch next so capture works again, then add better stop-request attribution logging (`requestedByPid` in runtime logs) if you want.

# User_unknown-time

No thanks.

Is it true that "clean" requests don't process unless the daemon is running?

**Verifying clean command offline handling**

I’ll verify this directly in the CLI/runtime code paths for `clean` so I can answer precisely.

**Confirming clean command noop behavior**

I confirmed `clean` CLI path; I’m pulling one more file reference for queue semantics so the behavior is unambiguous.

**Confirming clean command behavior**

</details>

I confirmed the queue semantics and control handler behavior. I’ll answer directly with exact current behavior (including a caveat that `clean` is currently consumed as a no-op).

Yes.

Current behavior is:

- `kato clean ...` **only enqueues** a control request in `control.json` from CLI: [clean.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/clean.ts).
- Requests are processed only by the daemon runtime loop when it polls the control queue: [daemon_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts).
- If daemon is not running, the request just sits in queue until daemon starts (queue persists on disk): [control_plane.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/control_plane.ts).

Important caveat: right now `handleControlRequest` has explicit logic for `export` and `stop`, but not `clean`, so a `clean` request is currently just marked processed without cleanup work.
