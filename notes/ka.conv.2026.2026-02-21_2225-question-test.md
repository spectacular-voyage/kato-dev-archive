Question test

::capture /home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-21_2225-question-test.md

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_0800_24

I’ll treat this as a planning request around the `question-test` note and first inspect that file (and related open notes) to infer what you want before asking any clarifying questions.

I inspected the captured note and related conversation context: the `question-test` file is intentionally blank except frontmatter, and nearby notes include an unfinished thread plus prior request to “provide a choice” for logging verification. I’m going to lock intent with one multiple-choice question so the plan can target the right test outcome.

**Decision [question-test-goal]:** What should this "Question test" turn validate? -> Choice Logging (Recommended)

The goal is now clear: validate choice logging. I’ll lock the exact test shape so the plan is fully specified and reproducible.

**Decision [choice-test-shape]:** Which test pattern should we plan for validating choice logging? -> One-Step Check (Recommended)

I have enough intent to draft a plan, but I’m doing one quick repo check for `::capture` semantics so the verification steps reference the actual workflow.

I confirmed repo guidance says lines beginning with `::...` are control-command text and should be ignored by the assistant unless explicitly asked to discuss command behavior, which matches your input format here. I’ll now finalize a decision-complete plan for the one-step choice-logging test.

One last decision materially affects acceptance criteria: whether success is prompt-only capture or prompt+selected-answer capture. I’ll lock that now so the plan is implementation-ready.

**Decision [choice-log-success]:** For this one-step logging test, what should count as a pass? -> Prompt + Answer (Recommended)

# User_2026-02-25_0800_24

hmm, capture didn't work.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_0800_24

I’ll quickly verify what actually happened by checking the target note file and recent runtime logs for `capture`/command-detection events, then I’ll narrow the failure point before proposing the fix plan.

The target note confirms no capture occurred: it still has only frontmatter (last modified `2026-02-24 22:26:55 -0800`). I also don’t see active runtime logs under repo-local `.kato`, so I’m tracing where this daemon instance expects its runtime dir and command ingestion from.

I found default runtime is `~/.kato/runtime` (not repo `.kato`), so I’ll inspect that location and current daemon status next; that should tell us whether the command was ingested or if no daemon/session watcher is active.

I found the daemon is running and capture works in general, but there is no `capture` event for your `question-test` path at all, which means that specific command was never detected/applied. I’m checking the newest operational log lines for parser/ingestion anomalies around this session timestamp.

No command-application or policy entries appeared after the earlier successful capture, so I’m now checking the raw Codex session logs for your exact `::capture ...question-test.md` line to see whether ingestion ever receives that text.

The raw Codex session definitely contains your exact `::capture ...question-test.md` line, so the failure is downstream in parsing/ingestion rather than user input. I’m inspecting the Codex provider parser for this specific event shape (`response_item.message.role=user` with `input_text`) to pinpoint the gap.

I found the session file includes the command on a `user_message` event exactly as expected, so next I’m verifying whether command detection is actually executed for Codex user events in runtime (it may be provider-gated).

Root cause is now clear from the environment: your `::capture ...question-test.md` line is present in the Codex session log at `2026-02-25T06:27:04Z`, but runtime never emitted any `recording.command.*` for that session after `06:19:47Z`. The command is being skipped by first-seen session bootstrapping in [daemon_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:377), which currently marks all existing events as “seen” and does `continue` on initial discovery.

**Decision [first-seen-command-policy]:** How should we handle control commands found in a session the first time the daemon sees that session? -> Just pause for a second so I can trigger capture. I had to restart the daemon

Understood. I’ll wait briefly, then immediately re-check the target note and runtime logs for a new `capture` event to confirm whether restart fixed it.

I checked after the pause: still no new `capture` events and the target note is unchanged, so restart alone didn’t recover this case. The first-session bootstrap skip is still the most likely root cause, and we can either use a short workaround now or plan the code fix path.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_0800_24

I’ll ignore that `::capture` line as an assistant instruction and treat it as a runtime control-command event; I’m checking the note file and daemon logs now to confirm whether it actually applied this time.

`::capture` worked this time.

If you want, I can now draft the fix plan so first-command-after-restart is reliable and doesn’t require reissuing `::capture`.

# User_2026-02-25_0800_24

OK, ask a question please.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_0800_24

I’ll issue a single deterministic multiple-choice prompt so we can verify question/answer capture end-to-end in this note.

**Decision [log-check-choice]:** Select one option for capture verification. -> Alpha (Recommended)

Question asked and answered. You selected `Alpha (Recommended)`.

Question asked and answered. You selected `Alpha (Recommended)`.

# User_2026-02-25_0800_24

True. But it didn't get recorded.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_0800_24

I’ll verify this directly by checking the note tail and daemon logs around the recent question/answer event, then I’ll identify exactly where the recording path dropped it.

I can already see the session is actively recording to that path, so this looks like a content-shape issue (what was recorded), not a write failure. I’m checking whether the prompt text and selected option were captured in the note.

Confirmed: the note contains only my summary line, not the actual prompt/selection payload. I’m pulling the raw Codex session entries for that moment to pinpoint why those details were omitted from markdown rendering.

The logs confirm recording is active; the miss is specifically that `request_user_input` content is not being materialized into recordable message/decision events in this path. I’ll quickly verify current render flags so we can pick the right fix strategy (parser mapping vs tool-call rendering).

You’re right: it was written, but not in the form you expected. The note has only the assistant summary line, while the actual question payload/selection were omitted because Codex logged them as `tool.call/tool.result`, and `writerIncludeToolCalls` is currently `false` by default. I need one implementation choice to make the capture include the real question+answer details consistently.

**Decision [question-capture-fix-path]:** Which behavior should we plan for question/answer capture from `request_user_input`? -> We just implemented for Claude, which also treats these prompt-questions as a tool call. What did we do in that situation? I'm guessing Parser Synthesis? I'd say it's probably okay to just treat some tool calls as non-tool-call events?

That matches what I’m seeing too. I’ll inspect the Claude parser path we implemented for `AskUserQuestion` and compare it directly to Codex’s `request_user_input` handling so we can mirror the same pattern.

I confirmed the root cause: `request_user_input` is parsed as `tool.call/tool.result`, and with `writerIncludeToolCalls=false` those details never make it into the note. I need one scope decision before finalizing the implementation plan: should we also backfill missing question/answer records into existing notes from logs, or only fix forward?

**Decision [backfill-scope]:** Should we repair past notes that missed `request_user_input` content, or only fix future captures? -> Fix forward only (Recommended)

# User_2026-02-25_0800_24

PLEASE IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN:
## Fix `request_user_input` Capture Recording for Codex

### Summary
`request_user_input` interactions are currently parsed as tool-call events, and tool calls are excluded from note rendering by default.  
Plan is to synthesize questionnaire events in the Codex parser (same model as Claude), so question + selected answer are captured in notes without changing tool-call visibility defaults.

### Important Interface/Type Changes
1. Internal parser output from Codex will add synthesized `message.user` and `decision` events when the tool name is `request_user_input`.
2. No public API changes.
3. Keep `writerIncludeToolCalls` default unchanged (`false`) in [openfeature.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/feature_flags/openfeature.ts).

### Implementation Plan
1. Update Codex event parsing in [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts) to:
   - Detect `response_item.function_call` where `name === "request_user_input"`.
   - Parse and cache questionnaire metadata by `call_id` (question text, options, ids).
2. Handle matching `response_item.function_call_output`:
   - Parse selected answer(s).
   - Emit synthesized `message.user` and `decision` events in timestamp/order-safe sequence.
3. Preserve existing behavior for all other function calls (`tool.call`/`tool.result` unchanged).
4. Add robust fallback:
   - If payload parsing fails, still emit a readable `message.user` event from raw output.
5. Keep fix-forward scope only:
   - No historical note backfill.

### Test Cases and Scenarios
1. Single-question flow with predefined option selected: note contains question and chosen option label.
2. Free-form “Other” response: note contains typed answer text.
3. Multiple-question flow: all answers mapped correctly to question ids.
4. Malformed tool output: graceful fallback text appears in note, no parser crash.
5. Non-`request_user_input` function calls: unchanged behavior regression check.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. A new Codex session using `request_user_input` records both prompt and user selection in capture notes.
2. Existing tool-call rendering flag defaults remain unchanged.
3. Parser tests for Codex questionnaire synthesis pass and protect against regressions.

### Assumptions and Defaults
1. Claude-style synthesized questionnaire events are the target behavior for Codex.
2. Only `request_user_input` gets special synthesis; other tool calls remain generic.
3. Historical notes are not rewritten.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_0800_24

I’m implementing this now by updating the Codex parser to synthesize `message.user`/`decision` for `request_user_input`, then adding parser tests and running the relevant test suite. I’ll first inspect the current Codex and Claude parser paths side-by-side to mirror behavior safely.

I found the parsers and confirmed there are existing unrelated workspace edits, so I’ll touch only Codex parser plus targeted tests. Next I’ll inspect the Codex parser and the Claude questionnaire handling to copy the intended event shape.

The Codex parser already has a legacy `request_user_input` branch, but the active stream is `response_item.function_call(_output)`, so I’ll add synthesis there and keep the legacy path intact. I’m now locating Codex parser tests to extend coverage for the five scenarios.

I’ve located the Codex parser tests and fixtures; next I’m checking the exact `ConversationEvent` decision shape so the synthesized events are type-safe and match renderer expectations.

I’m now implementing against real payload shapes rather than assumptions by scanning existing Codex session logs for `request_user_input` outputs. This lets us parse selected options and “Other” answers correctly on first pass.

I found the exact live payload format for `request_user_input` outputs (`{\"answers\":{\"<id>\":{\"answers\":[...]}}}`), including free-form answers in the same shape. I’m now patching the Codex parser to synthesize events from that format and then adding a dedicated fixture plus tests for the five scenarios.

I’ve gathered enough context and I’m starting file edits now. I’ll modify `apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts` to cache `request_user_input` question metadata on tool call and synthesize user/decision events on the matching tool result, including malformed-output fallback.

I’ve finished the parser changes and I’m now adding a dedicated Codex fixture plus parser tests that cover selected option, free-form answer, multi-question mapping, malformed output fallback, and unchanged non-question tool behavior.

Parser and tests are in place; next I’m formatting the touched TypeScript files and then running the focused Codex parser/fixture tests before broader verification.

The focused test pass is clean with read permissions (`18 passed`). I’m doing a final diff review of only the touched files to confirm event shapes and references before I summarize.

I’m making one small hardening tweak before finalizing: tightening the answer-shape detector so we only auto-synthesize on the known `request_user_input` output schema when no cached call metadata is available.

Implemented end-to-end.

- Added `request_user_input` parsing helpers and decision-key normalization in [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:49).

- On matching `response_item.function_call_output`, now synthesizes `message.user` + `decision` events (while preserving `tool.result`) in [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:459).
- Added malformed-output fallback to still emit readable `message.user` content in [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:564).

# User_2026-02-25_0800_24

OK, let's try another question

::capture [conv.2026.2026-02-21_2225-question-test.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-21_2225-question-test.md) 

Thanks.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_0800_24

I’ll run one quick non-mutating check on the capture target note so we’re grounded, then I’ll issue a new multiple-choice question for this recording test.

I confirmed the note is currently active and has your latest command at the tail. I’m issuing one deterministic capture-test question now.

**Decision [capture-test-round-2]:** Select one option for round-2 capture verification. -> Delta (Recommended)

Round-2 question completed and answered.

Selected option: `Delta (Recommended)`.

Round-2 question completed and answered.

Selected option: `Delta (Recommended)`.

# User_2026-02-25_0800_24

Ah, but I want to capture your questions/all options, not just my response. For both Claude and Codex please.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_0800_24

I’ll ground this in the current behavior first by checking what the note is actually rendering for recent Claude/Codex question interactions, then I’ll map the minimal changes needed to capture full question text plus all options for both providers.

I confirmed the root issue in current output: decision metadata already carries question options, but the markdown writer only prints summary/status, so options are dropped. I’m now checking existing writer/parser tests so we can plan exactly where to add provider-agnostic rendering without regressions.

I’ve narrowed this to two concrete gaps: Codex currently emits accepted decisions but not proposed question prompts, and the markdown writer does not render decision option metadata for either provider. I need one formatting decision from you to finalize a decision-complete plan.

**Decision [question-option-render-style]:** When capturing question prompts, how should options be rendered in notes? -> I'm not sure if I see the description. e.g. for this prompt, option 1 says "Label + description (Recommended)" Is Recommended the description?

`(Recommended)` in that choice is just my suggested default label, not the option description. The description is the sentence shown below each label. I’ll re-ask with explicit examples so you can pick the output shape you want.

**Decision [option-format-explicit]:** Which exact note output do you want under each question prompt? -> Label + description (Recommended)

That format is clear. One more choice will lock whether notes should show both the prompt block and your final selection block, or only the prompt block.

**Decision [decision-line-policy]:** For each question, should notes include both the proposed prompt and the accepted answer decision? -> Show both (Recommended)

# User_2026-02-25_0800_24

The User response has some redundancy:

# User_2026-02-24_2338_07

- decision_line_policy: Show both (Recommended)

**Decision [decision-line-policy]:** decision_line_policy -> Show both (Recommended)
*Status: accepted — decided by: user*

We don't need all that.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_0800_24

I see the redundancy you’re pointing at, and I’ll trace exactly where both lines are emitted so we can remove the duplicate form cleanly. I’m checking parser and writer paths for Claude/Codex answer synthesis now.

You’re right: the duplicate comes from two separate synthesized outputs for the same answer (`message.user` bullet + accepted `decision`). I need one formatting choice to lock the fix for both Claude and Codex.

**Decision [question-answer-render-policy]:** For questionnaire answers in captured notes, which form should we keep? -> Single decision line (Recommended)

# User_2026-02-25_0800_24

PLEASE IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN:
## Remove Redundant Questionnaire Answer Rendering (Claude + Codex)

### Summary
The redundancy comes from rendering both:
- a synthesized `message.user` answer line, and
- an accepted `decision` line (plus status).

Plan is to keep only one compact accepted decision line for structured questionnaire answers, for both providers.

### Important Interface / Type Changes
- No public API changes.
- Internal event-shape change:
  - Stop emitting synthesized `message.user` events for structured questionnaire answers.
  - Keep accepted `decision` events as the canonical answer record.

### Implementation Plan
1. Update Codex parser in [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts).
- In `response_item.function_call_output` for parsed `request_user_input` answers:
  - remove synthesized `message.user` emission.
  - keep accepted `decision` emission.
- Keep malformed-output fallback `message.user` emission (when no structured answers parse), so information is not lost.

2. Update Claude parser in [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/claude/parser.ts).
- In `toolUseResult` questionnaire answer handling:
  - remove synthesized `message.user` emission for structured answers.
  - keep accepted `decision` emission unchanged.

3. Update markdown rendering in [markdown_writer.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/writer/markdown_writer.ts).
- For accepted questionnaire decisions (identified via `metadata.providerQuestionId`):
  - render only one line: `**Decision [key]:** ...`
  - do not render the status sub-line for that case.
- Leave non-questionnaire decisions unchanged.

### Test Cases and Scenarios
1. Codex structured answer:
- no synthesized user bullet appears.
- exactly one accepted decision line appears.
2. Claude structured answer:
- no synthesized user bullet appears.
- exactly one accepted decision line appears.
3. Malformed Codex answer fallback:
- user message fallback still appears.
4. Non-questionnaire decisions:
- existing rendering behavior remains unchanged.
5. Regression:
- parser and writer tests pass for both providers.

### Assumptions and Defaults
- Scope is limited to structured questionnaire answers only.
- “Single decision line” policy applies only to questionnaire accepted decisions.
- Proposed/prompt decision handling is unchanged in this adjustment.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_0800_24

I’m implementing this now across the Codex parser, Claude parser, and markdown writer, then I’ll update tests to lock the new single-line decision behavior. I’ll first re-read the current code paths and existing tests so the changes are precise and minimal.

I’m editing the parsers now to stop emitting structured questionnaire `message.user` answer bullets while preserving accepted `decision` events and malformed-output fallback. After that I’ll update writer rendering and tests.

I’ve updated parser tests and I’m now adding writer tests to enforce the new “single decision line for questionnaire answers” rule while keeping normal decision rendering unchanged.

I spotted one edge-case gap while reviewing: the legacy Codex `request_user_input` path did not attach questionnaire metadata on accepted decisions, which would keep a status line there. I’m patching that now so the single-line behavior is consistent across Codex paths.

Implemented exactly as requested.

- Removed structured questionnaire `message.user` answer emission in Codex response-item flow; accepted `decision` remains canonical, and malformed-output fallback `message.user` is preserved: [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:470).
- Removed structured questionnaire `message.user` answer emission in Claude `toolUseResult` handling; accepted `decision` remains: [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/claude/parser.ts:299).
- Added questionnaire metadata to Codex legacy `request_user_input` accepted decisions so rendering behavior is consistent across Codex paths: [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:637).
- Updated markdown writer so accepted questionnaire decisions (identified by `metadata.providerQuestionId`) render as a single compact decision line with no status sub-line; non-questionnaire decisions are unchanged: [markdown_writer.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/writer/markdown_writer.ts:285).
- Updated parser tests to assert no synthesized structured answer bullets for Claude/Codex: [codex-parser_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/codex-parser_test.ts:177), [claude-parser_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/claude-parser_test.ts:195).
- Added writer regression tests for single-line questionnaire decisions and unchanged generic decision status rendering: [writer-markdown_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/writer-markdown_test.ts:424).

Validation run:
- `deno test --allow-read --allow-write tests/codex-parser_test.ts tests/claude-parser_test.ts tests/writer-markdown_test.ts`
- Result: `32 passed, 0 failed`.

Implemented exactly as requested.

- Added writer regression tests for single-line questionnaire decisions and unchanged generic decision status rendering: [writer-markdown_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/writer-markdown_test.ts:424).

Validation run:
- `deno test --allow-read --allow-write tests/codex-parser_test.ts tests/claude-parser_test.ts tests/writer-markdown_test.ts`
- Result: `32 passed, 0 failed`.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_1016_46

I see the failure mode: the note captured a decision line plus duplicate confirmation text, but not the questionnaire prompt/options block. I’m going to inspect the parser and writer paths for questionnaire prompt rendering and the duplicated “Done…” text source before proposing the exact fix.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_1016_56

I found concrete references to the duplicate lines and questionnaire synthesis paths. Next I’m checking the exact event sequence around those lines and the parser/writer logic that decides whether the question prompt/options are rendered.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_1017_01

I confirmed writer behavior is doing what we changed earlier: accepted questionnaire decisions render as a single line only. I’m now inspecting Claude/Codex questionnaire prompt synthesis to see why prompt/options are not emitted as non-tool events at all.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_1017_39

I’ve pinpointed one core gap: Codex currently emits accepted questionnaire decisions but does not synthesize a proposed prompt event (the path Claude uses for question text/options). I’m now checking the raw session event stream for this exact turn to confirm whether the duplicate “Done…” comes from duplicate provider message events or from our parser/writer.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_1017_57

Root cause is confirmed from raw session: the duplicate “Done…” is coming from two provider events for the same text (`event_msg.agent_message` + `response_item.message.final_answer`), and our parser currently emits both. I’m now checking writer/parser tests for proposed-decision rendering to lock how prompt + full options should appear for both Claude and Codex.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_1019_00

I’ve isolated two separate issues: prompt/options are missing because Codex doesn’t emit questionnaire “proposed” events, and duplicate “Done…” lines come from same-turn `agent_message` + `final_answer` duplicates in raw Codex logs. I need two policy choices to finalize a decision-complete fix plan that matches your preferred output.

**Decision [duplicate-assistant-dedupe-policy]:** duplicate_assistant_dedupe_policy -> Same-turn dedupe (Recommended)

**Decision [question-prompt-render-format]:** question_prompt_render_format -> Decision + options list (Recommended)

# User_2026-02-25_1026_07

I didn't see your policy questions, maybe because plan mode wasn't turned on? I turned it on, try again please.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_1026_10

I’ll re-send the plan-mode policy questions now through `request_user_input` so they appear in the questionnaire UI and get captured correctly.

**Decision [question-prompt-render-format]:** question_prompt_render_format -> Decision + options list (Recommended)

**Decision [duplicate-assistant-dedupe-policy]:** duplicate_assistant_dedupe_policy -> Same-turn dedupe (Recommended)

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_1027_20

# User_2026-02-25_1053_08

PLEASE IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN:
## Fix Questionnaire Prompt/Options Capture + Duplicate Assistant Lines (Claude + Codex)

### Summary
Capture should include both:
1. The questionnaire prompt with all options, and
2. The accepted answer (single compact decision line, as already standardized).

Also remove duplicate assistant lines when Codex emits the same text as both `agent_message` and `final_answer` in the same turn.

Selected policies:
- Prompt rendering: `Decision + options list`
- Duplicate handling: `Same-turn dedupe`

### Important Interface / Type Changes
- No public API changes.
- No feature-flag default changes (`writerIncludeToolCalls` remains `false`).
- Internal event/render behavior changes only:
  1. Codex parser will synthesize questionnaire **proposed** `decision` events from `request_user_input` function calls.
  2. Markdown writer will render questionnaire proposed decisions with option lists.
  3. Markdown writer will dedupe identical same-turn assistant lines (prefer final over commentary when they are identical).

### Implementation Plan

1. Codex parser: synthesize questionnaire prompt decisions
- File: `apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts`
- In `response_item.function_call` handling for `name === "request_user_input"`:
  - Keep existing `tool.call` behavior unchanged.
  - Parse `questions` and emit one `decision` per question:
    - `status: "proposed"`
    - `decidedBy: "assistant"`
    - `summary: <question text>`
    - `metadata` includes:
      - `providerQuestionId` (question `id` when present; fallback deterministic key)
      - `header` (if present)
      - `options` (label + description)
      - `multiSelect` (if present)
    - `basisEventIds` references the related `tool.call` event.
- Decision key normalization:
  - Prefer question `id` when available for stable pairing with accepted decision.
  - Fallback to normalized question text/index.

2. Codex parser: make request-user-input mapping resume-safe across `fromOffset`
- File: `apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts`
- Parse/cache `request_user_input` `function_call` metadata regardless of `lineEnd > fromOffset`, while only **emitting** events when `lineEnd > fromOffset`.
- Process `function_call_output` bookkeeping (including pending-map delete) regardless of offset, but emit only when `lineEnd > fromOffset`.
- Result:
  - If call is before offset and output is after offset, accepted decision still gets question metadata (question text/options), not just raw question id.

3. Markdown writer: render questionnaire prompt options
- File: `apps/daemon/src/writer/markdown_writer.ts`
- For `decision` events with `status === "proposed"` and questionnaire metadata (`options` list):
  - Render:
    - `**Decision [key]:** <question summary>`
    - option bullets, one per option:
      - `- <label>: <description>` when description exists
      - `- <label>` when description is empty
  - Keep existing non-questionnaire decision rendering unchanged.
- Keep accepted questionnaire decision policy unchanged:
  - single compact decision line
  - no status sub-line.

4. Markdown writer: same-turn assistant duplicate suppression
- File: `apps/daemon/src/writer/markdown_writer.ts`
- Add same-turn duplicate logic for assistant messages:
  - If a commentary assistant message is immediately followed by a final assistant message in the same turn with identical normalized content, suppress the earlier commentary copy and keep the final copy.
  - Also suppress exact immediate assistant duplicates with same turn/content signature.
- Scope this dedupe to assistant message rendering only; do not affect user/system/tool/decision events.

5. Claude compatibility path
- No parser behavior change required for prompt synthesis (already emits proposed questionnaire decisions with options metadata).
- Validate that writer option rendering now surfaces Claude questionnaire options in notes.

### Test Cases and Scenarios

1. Codex prompt synthesis
- Input includes `response_item.function_call` `request_user_input`.
- Expected:
  - proposed `decision` emitted with question summary + options metadata.

2. Codex accepted answer with pre-offset call
- Parse with `fromOffset` between function_call and function_call_output.
- Expected:
  - accepted `decision` still maps to question text/options (not raw id-only fallback).

3. Writer prompt/options rendering
- Given proposed questionnaire decision with options metadata.
- Expected markdown includes:
  - one proposed decision line
  - all options rendered as bullets.

4. Writer accepted questionnaire rendering regression
- Given accepted questionnaire decision (`metadata.providerQuestionId`).
- Expected:
  - single decision line only
  - no status line.

5. Duplicate assistant line dedupe
- Given same-turn assistant commentary + final with identical content.
- Expected:
  - exactly one rendered assistant line (final-preferred behavior).

6. Claude regression
- Existing AskUserQuestion parse + writer render includes question prompt and options list; accepted answer remains compact.

7. Non-questionnaire decisions/messages regression
- Existing rendering and parser behavior unchanged.

### Assumptions and Defaults
- Questionnaire prompt/options should be represented via proposed `decision` events (not tool-call visibility changes).
- Duplicate suppression applies to note rendering only (does not alter stored raw provider logs).
- Historical notes are not backfilled; fix-forward only.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_1053_18

I’m implementing this now exactly as specified. I’ll first re-check the current parser/writer code and tests, then patch `codex/parser.ts` and `markdown_writer.ts`, and finally run the targeted test suite for parser/writer regressions.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_1053_22

I’ve confirmed the current state and there are no conflicting code changes outside docs. I’m now patching `codex/parser.ts` to emit proposed questionnaire decisions and make request/response mapping resume-safe, then I’ll patch the markdown writer for option rendering and assistant dedupe.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_1055_19

I’m now editing the markdown writer to add two behaviors: proposed-question option rendering and same-turn assistant duplicate suppression (commentary suppressed when identical final follows). After that I’ll extend tests for both parser and writer paths.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_1056_19

I’m extending tests now. I’ll update existing Codex questionnaire assertions for the new proposed events, add a resume-offset regression test for metadata carryover, and then add writer tests for option rendering and assistant dedupe.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_1057_12

Parser and writer patches are in place, and I’ve updated/added tests for proposed questionnaire prompts, resume-safe mapping, and duplicate assistant suppression. I’m running the targeted test suite now to catch any type or behavior regressions.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_1057_26

One Codex fallback assertion needed updating because malformed questionnaire now legitimately emits a proposed prompt decision. I’ve patched that expectation and I’m re-running the same targeted test set.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_1058_03

Implemented.

### What changed

- Updated Codex parser to synthesize **proposed questionnaire decisions** from `response_item.function_call` (`request_user_input`), including `providerQuestionId`, `header`, `options`, and `multiSelect` metadata, while keeping normal `tool.call` behavior intact:  
[parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:402)

- Made `request_user_input` mapping **resume-safe across `fromOffset`**:
  - caches `function_call` questionnaire metadata even before offset,
  - processes `function_call_output` bookkeeping before offset,
  - emits only when past offset.  
[parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:500)

- Kept accepted questionnaire answers as canonical accepted `decision` events, now with stable keying/metadata mapping (including resumed parses):  
[parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:541)

- Added same proposed-question synthesis to legacy Codex `request_user_input` parser path for consistency:  
[parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:662)

- Updated markdown rendering:
  - proposed questionnaire decisions render as:
    - `**Decision [key]:** ...`
    - option bullets (`- label: description`),
  - accepted questionnaire decisions remain single-line compact (no status line),
  - same-turn duplicate assistant lines are suppressed (commentary dropped when identical final follows; immediate same-turn assistant duplicates deduped).  
[markdown_writer.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/writer/markdown_writer.ts:200)

- No changes to feature-flag defaults (`writerIncludeToolCalls` remains `false`).

### Tests updated

- Codex parser coverage for:
  - proposed prompt synthesis with options,
  - accepted answer mapping with provider question id,
  - resume-offset metadata carryover,
  - malformed output fallback without accepted decision regression.  
[tests/codex-parser_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/codex-parser_test.ts:189)

- Claude parser regression to assert prompt options metadata still present:  
[tests/claude-parser_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/claude-parser_test.ts:195)

- Writer tests for:
  - proposed questionnaire option rendering,
  - accepted questionnaire compact rendering,
  - assistant duplicate suppression rules.  
[tests/writer-markdown_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/writer-markdown_test.ts:424)

### Verification run

Executed:

```sh
deno test --allow-read --allow-write tests/codex-parser_test.ts tests/claude-parser_test.ts tests/writer-markdown_test.ts
```

Result: `36 passed, 0 failed`.

If you want, I can now run a live `::capture` round and confirm the new note output shape end-to-end.

**Preparing question input**

</details>

I inspected the captured note and related conversation context: the `question-test` file is intentionally blank except frontmatter, and nearby notes include an unfinished thread plus prior request to “provide a choice” for logging verification. I’m going to lock intent with one multiple-choice question so the plan can target the right test outcome.

**Decision [question-test-goal]:** What should this "Question test" turn validate?
- Choice Logging (Recommended): I ask one concrete multiple-choice question to verify question/answer capture logging end-to-end.
- Bug Plan: I build a decision-complete troubleshooting plan for the "Sessions: (none)" vs memory-count mismatch.
- Doc Update Plan: I draft a plan for how this conversation should be recorded/structured in the notes docs.

- One-Step Check (Recommended): Run one additional multiple-choice prompt and verify the selected option is captured in the conversation note.
- Two-Step Branch: Run an initial choice plus a conditional follow-up to verify branching answers are captured correctly.
- Assumption Capture: Run a choice prompt and verify default/recommended-option behavior when answers are minimal.

- Prompt + Answer (Recommended): The captured conversation includes both the multiple-choice prompt and the selected option text.
- Prompt + Option IDs: Capture must include the prompt plus structured choice identifiers/metadata for the selected option.
- Prompt Only: Only the question prompt needs to be captured; answer capture is not required.

I’ll quickly verify what actually happened by checking the target note file and recent runtime logs for `capture`/command-detection events, then I’ll narrow the failure point before proposing the fix plan.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Investigating daemon runtime directory**

</details>

The target note confirms no capture occurred: it still has only frontmatter (last modified `2026-02-24 22:26:55 -0800`). I also don’t see active runtime logs under repo-local `.kato`, so I’m tracing where this daemon instance expects its runtime dir and command ingestion from.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Investigating command capture flow**

</details>

I found default runtime is `~/.kato/runtime` (not repo `.kato`), so I’ll inspect that location and current daemon status next; that should tell us whether the command was ingested or if no daemon/session watcher is active.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Inspecting command detection gaps**

</details>

I found the daemon is running and capture works in general, but there is no `capture` event for your `question-test` path at all, which means that specific command was never detected/applied. I’m checking the newest operational log lines for parser/ingestion anomalies around this session timestamp.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Inspecting codex session logs**

</details>

No command-application or policy entries appeared after the earlier successful capture, so I’m now checking the raw Codex session logs for your exact `::capture ...question-test.md` line to see whether ingestion ever receives that text.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Inspecting parser support for message type**

</details>

The raw Codex session definitely contains your exact `::capture ...question-test.md` line, so the failure is downstream in parsing/ingestion rather than user input. I’m inspecting the Codex provider parser for this specific event shape (`response_item.message.role=user` with `input_text`) to pinpoint the gap.

Root cause is now clear from the environment: your `::capture ...question-test.md` line is present in the Codex session log at `2026-02-25T06:27:04Z`, but runtime never emitted any `recording.command.*` for that session after `06:19:47Z`. The command is being skipped by first-seen session bootstrapping in [daemon_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:377), which currently marks all existing events as “seen” and does `continue` on initial discovery.

**Decision [first-seen-command-policy]:** How should we handle control commands found in a session the first time the daemon sees that session?
- Process Fresh First Command (Recommended): On first-seen sessions, execute only the newest user control command when the session/file is freshly updated, while still skipping old historical events.
- Process All First-Seen Commands: Execute every command in the initial event backlog (highest chance of replaying stale commands on daemon restart).
- Keep Current Behavior: Never execute first-seen backlog commands; users must issue command again after session is already tracked.

**Decision [first-seen-command-policy]:** How should we handle control commands found in a session the first time the daemon sees that session? -> Just pause for a second so I can trigger capture. I had to restart the daemon

<details>

I checked after the pause: still no new `capture` events and the target note is unchanged, so restart alone didn’t recover this case. The first-session bootstrap skip is still the most likely root cause, and we can either use a short workaround now or plan the code fix path.

- Daemon logs show successful command handling at `2026-02-25T06:41:00Z`:
  - `recording.capture`
  - `recording.rotate`
  - `recording.command.applied`
  - `policy.decision` allow for that exact path and session `019c937a-2546-74e2-8e3c-ed47350eaa31`.

I’ll verify this directly by checking the note tail and daemon logs around the recent question/answer event, then I’ll identify exactly where the recording path dropped it.

**Inspecting question capture at file tail**

</details>

I can already see the session is actively recording to that path, so this looks like a content-shape issue (what was recorded), not a write failure. I’m checking whether the prompt text and selected option were captured in the note.

**Analyzing missing user prompt handling**

Confirmed: the note contains only my summary line, not the actual prompt/selection payload. I’m pulling the raw Codex session entries for that moment to pinpoint why those details were omitted from markdown rendering.

The logs confirm recording is active; the miss is specifically that `request_user_input` content is not being materialized into recordable message/decision events in this path. I’ll quickly verify current render flags so we can pick the right fix strategy (parser mapping vs tool-call rendering).

**Planning user input fix**

</details>

You’re right: it was written, but not in the form you expected. The note has only the assistant summary line, while the actual question payload/selection were omitted because Codex logged them as `tool.call/tool.result`, and `writerIncludeToolCalls` is currently `false` by default. I need one implementation choice to make the capture include the real question+answer details consistently.

**Decision [question-capture-fix-path]:** Which behavior should we plan for question/answer capture from `request_user_input`?
- Parser Synthesis (Recommended): Map `response_item` `request_user_input` call+result into `message.user` + `decision` events so prompt/answer are captured even when tool-call rendering is off.
- Enable Tool Calls Globally: Set `writerIncludeToolCalls=true` so raw tool events are rendered, including question/answer payloads.
- Both: Enable tool-call rendering and also add parser synthesis for explicit user/decision records.

**Decision [question-capture-fix-path]:** Which behavior should we plan for question/answer capture from `request_user_input`? -> We just implemented for Claude, which also treats these prompt-questions as a tool call. What did we do in that situation? I'm guessing Parser Synthesis? I'd say it's probably okay to just treat some tool calls as non-tool-call events?

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Exploring Claude parser logic**

</details>

That matches what I’m seeing too. I’ll inspect the Claude parser path we implemented for `AskUserQuestion` and compare it directly to Codex’s `request_user_input` handling so we can mirror the same pattern.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Confirming backfill preference**

</details>

I confirmed the root cause: `request_user_input` is parsed as `tool.call/tool.result`, and with `writerIncludeToolCalls=false` those details never make it into the note. I need one scope decision before finalizing the implementation plan: should we also backfill missing question/answer records into existing notes from logs, or only fix forward?

**Decision [backfill-scope]:** Should we repair past notes that missed `request_user_input` content, or only fix future captures?
- Fix forward only (Recommended): Implement parser/test changes for new sessions; no historical rewrite.
- Backfill this note only: Add a one-off repair for this conversation file from existing logs.
- Backfill all affected notes: Build a script/process to scan logs and patch all missing questionnaire entries.

# User_unknown-time

PLEASE IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN:
## Fix `request_user_input` Capture Recording for Codex

### Summary
`request_user_input` interactions are currently parsed as tool-call events, and tool calls are excluded from note rendering by default.  
Plan is to synthesize questionnaire events in the Codex parser (same model as Claude), so question + selected answer are captured in notes without changing tool-call visibility defaults.

### Important Interface/Type Changes
1. Internal parser output from Codex will add synthesized `message.user` and `decision` events when the tool name is `request_user_input`.
2. No public API changes.
3. Keep `writerIncludeToolCalls` default unchanged (`false`) in [openfeature.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/feature_flags/openfeature.ts).

### Implementation Plan
1. Update Codex event parsing in [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts) to:
   - Detect `response_item.function_call` where `name === "request_user_input"`.
   - Parse and cache questionnaire metadata by `call_id` (question text, options, ids).
2. Handle matching `response_item.function_call_output`:
   - Parse selected answer(s).
   - Emit synthesized `message.user` and `decision` events in timestamp/order-safe sequence.
3. Preserve existing behavior for all other function calls (`tool.call`/`tool.result` unchanged).
4. Add robust fallback:
   - If payload parsing fails, still emit a readable `message.user` event from raw output.
5. Keep fix-forward scope only:
   - No historical note backfill.

### Test Cases and Scenarios
1. Single-question flow with predefined option selected: note contains question and chosen option label.
2. Free-form “Other” response: note contains typed answer text.
3. Multiple-question flow: all answers mapped correctly to question ids.
4. Malformed tool output: graceful fallback text appears in note, no parser crash.
5. Non-`request_user_input` function calls: unchanged behavior regression check.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. A new Codex session using `request_user_input` records both prompt and user selection in capture notes.
2. Existing tool-call rendering flag defaults remain unchanged.
3. Parser tests for Codex questionnaire synthesis pass and protect against regressions.

### Assumptions and Defaults
1. Claude-style synthesized questionnaire events are the target behavior for Codex.
2. Only `request_user_input` gets special synthesis; other tool calls remain generic.
3. Historical notes are not rewritten.

**Starting implementation phase**

</details>

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

I’m implementing this now by updating the Codex parser to synthesize `message.user`/`decision` for `request_user_input`, then adding parser tests and running the relevant test suite. I’ll first inspect the current Codex and Claude parser paths side-by-side to mirror behavior safely.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Locating relevant parser tests**

</details>

I found the parsers and confirmed there are existing unrelated workspace edits, so I’ll touch only Codex parser plus targeted tests. Next I’ll inspect the Codex parser and the Claude questionnaire handling to copy the intended event shape.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Investigating codex parser tests**

</details>

The Codex parser already has a legacy `request_user_input` branch, but the active stream is `response_item.function_call(_output)`, so I’ll add synthesis there and keep the legacy path intact. I’m now locating Codex parser tests to extend coverage for the five scenarios.

- Added `request_user_input` parsing helpers and decision-key normalization in [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:49).
- Cached `request_user_input` question metadata by `call_id` when `response_item.function_call` is seen in [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:430).
- On matching `response_item.function_call_output`, now synthesizes `message.user` + `decision` events (while preserving `tool.result`) in [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:459).
- Added malformed-output fallback to still emit readable `message.user` content in [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:564).
- Added fixture [codex-session-request-user-input.jsonl](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/fixtures/codex-session-request-user-input.jsonl:1).
- Added Codex parser tests for:
  - selected option
  - free-form answer
  - multi-question mapping
  - malformed output fallback
  - non-`request_user_input` regression  
  in [codex-parser_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/codex-parser_test.ts:177).
- Registered new fixture in [fixtures_port_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/fixtures_port_test.ts:21).

Validation run:
- `deno test --allow-read tests/codex-parser_test.ts tests/fixtures_port_test.ts`
- Result: `18 passed, 0 failed`.

`writerIncludeToolCalls` defaults were not changed.

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

I’ll ground this in the current behavior first by checking what the note is actually rendering for recent Claude/Codex question interactions, then I’ll map the minimal changes needed to capture full question text plus all options for both providers.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Scoping user prompts for plan mode**

</details>

I confirmed the root issue in current output: decision metadata already carries question options, but the markdown writer only prints summary/status, so options are dropped. I’m now checking existing writer/parser tests so we can plan exactly where to add provider-agnostic rendering without regressions.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Planning user decision prompts**

</details>

I’ve narrowed this to two concrete gaps: Codex currently emits accepted decisions but not proposed question prompts, and the markdown writer does not render decision option metadata for either provider. I need one formatting decision from you to finalize a decision-complete plan.

**Decision [question-option-render-style]:** When capturing question prompts, how should options be rendered in notes?
- Label + description (Recommended): Render every option label plus its description under the decision prompt for full context.
- Label only: Render only option labels for a shorter note format.
- Collapsed JSON block: Render raw option metadata in a fenced JSON block under the decision.

**Decision [question-option-render-style]:** When capturing question prompts, how should options be rendered in notes? -> I'm not sure if I see the description. e.g. for this prompt, option 1 says "Label + description (Recommended)" Is Recommended the description?

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Clarifying user confusion with examples**

</details>

`(Recommended)` in that choice is just my suggested default label, not the option description. The description is the sentence shown below each label. I’ll re-ask with explicit examples so you can pick the output shape you want.

**Decision [option-format-explicit]:** Which exact note output do you want under each question prompt?
- Label + description (Recommended): Example: `- Delta: Baseline selection path.`
- Label only: Example: `- Delta`
- Raw JSON block: Example: one fenced `json` block with all option fields verbatim.

**Decision [option-format-explicit]:** Which exact note output do you want under each question prompt? -> Label + description (Recommended)

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Clarifying handling of accepted decisions**

</details>

That format is clear. One more choice will lock whether notes should show both the prompt block and your final selection block, or only the prompt block.

**Decision [decision-line-policy]:** For each question, should notes include both the proposed prompt and the accepted answer decision?
- Show both (Recommended): Keep proposed prompt/options and accepted selected answer for full traceability.
- Prompt only: Show only question/options and omit accepted decision lines.
- Accepted only: Show only final selected answer lines and omit prompt/options.

You’re right: the duplicate comes from two separate synthesized outputs for the same answer (`message.user` bullet + accepted `decision`). I need one formatting choice to lock the fix for both Claude and Codex.

# User_unknown-time

PLEASE IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN:
## Remove Redundant Questionnaire Answer Rendering (Claude + Codex)

### Summary
The redundancy comes from rendering both:
- a synthesized `message.user` answer line, and
- an accepted `decision` line (plus status).

Plan is to keep only one compact accepted decision line for structured questionnaire answers, for both providers.

### Important Interface / Type Changes
- No public API changes.
- Internal event-shape change:
  - Stop emitting synthesized `message.user` events for structured questionnaire answers.
  - Keep accepted `decision` events as the canonical answer record.

### Implementation Plan
1. Update Codex parser in [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts).
- In `response_item.function_call_output` for parsed `request_user_input` answers:
  - remove synthesized `message.user` emission.
  - keep accepted `decision` emission.
- Keep malformed-output fallback `message.user` emission (when no structured answers parse), so information is not lost.

2. Update Claude parser in [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/claude/parser.ts).
- In `toolUseResult` questionnaire answer handling:
  - remove synthesized `message.user` emission for structured answers.
  - keep accepted `decision` emission unchanged.

3. Update markdown rendering in [markdown_writer.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/writer/markdown_writer.ts).
- For accepted questionnaire decisions (identified via `metadata.providerQuestionId`):
  - render only one line: `**Decision [key]:** ...`
  - do not render the status sub-line for that case.
- Leave non-questionnaire decisions unchanged.

### Test Cases and Scenarios
1. Codex structured answer:
- no synthesized user bullet appears.
- exactly one accepted decision line appears.
2. Claude structured answer:
- no synthesized user bullet appears.
- exactly one accepted decision line appears.
3. Malformed Codex answer fallback:
- user message fallback still appears.
4. Non-questionnaire decisions:
- existing rendering behavior remains unchanged.
5. Regression:
- parser and writer tests pass for both providers.

### Assumptions and Defaults
- Scope is limited to structured questionnaire answers only.
- “Single decision line” policy applies only to questionnaire accepted decisions.
- Proposed/prompt decision handling is unchanged in this adjustment.

Implemented exactly as requested.

- Removed structured questionnaire `message.user` answer emission in Codex response-item flow; accepted `decision` remains canonical, and malformed-output fallback `message.user` is preserved: [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:470).
- Removed structured questionnaire `message.user` answer emission in Claude `toolUseResult` handling; accepted `decision` remains: [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/claude/parser.ts:299).
- Added questionnaire metadata to Codex legacy `request_user_input` accepted decisions so rendering behavior is consistent across Codex paths: [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:637).
- Updated markdown writer so accepted questionnaire decisions (identified by `metadata.providerQuestionId`) render as a single compact decision line with no status sub-line; non-questionnaire decisions are unchanged: [markdown_writer.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/writer/markdown_writer.ts:285).
- Updated parser tests to assert no synthesized structured answer bullets for Claude/Codex: [codex-parser_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/codex-parser_test.ts:177), [claude-parser_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/claude-parser_test.ts:195).
- Added writer regression tests for single-line questionnaire decisions and unchanged generic decision status rendering: [writer-markdown_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/writer-markdown_test.ts:424).

Validation run:
- `deno test --allow-read --allow-write tests/codex-parser_test.ts tests/claude-parser_test.ts tests/writer-markdown_test.ts`

That didn't work. Here's the output:

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-25_0804_59

Understood. I’ll do a quick non-mutating check of the active note context, then I’ll ask the plan-mode multiple-choice question again using the questionnaire tool.

I’m posting the plan-mode questionnaire now so you can test capture of the full question/options path.

**Decision [plan-mode-capture-round]:** plan_mode_capture_round -> Prompt + options + answer (Recommended)

Done. Your selected answer was: `Prompt + options + answer (Recommended)`.

I see the failure mode: the note captured a decision line plus duplicate confirmation text, but not the questionnaire prompt/options block. I’m going to inspect the parser and writer paths for questionnaire prompt rendering and the duplicated “Done…” text source before proposing the exact fix.

**Inspecting parser around decision events**

I confirmed writer behavior is doing what we changed earlier: accepted questionnaire decisions render as a single line only. I’m now inspecting Claude/Codex questionnaire prompt synthesis to see why prompt/options are not emitted as non-tool events at all.

I’ve pinpointed one core gap: Codex currently emits accepted questionnaire decisions but does not synthesize a proposed prompt event (the path Claude uses for question text/options). I’m now checking the raw session event stream for this exact turn to confirm whether the duplicate “Done…” comes from duplicate provider message events or from our parser/writer.

<details>

**Diagnosing duplicate assistant message rendering**

</details>

Root cause is confirmed from raw session: the duplicate “Done…” is coming from two provider events for the same text (`event_msg.agent_message` + `response_item.message.final_answer`), and our parser currently emits both. I’m now checking writer/parser tests for proposed-decision rendering to lock how prompt + full options should appear for both Claude and Codex.

I’ve isolated two separate issues: prompt/options are missing because Codex doesn’t emit questionnaire “proposed” events, and duplicate “Done…” lines come from same-turn `agent_message` + `final_answer` duplicates in raw Codex logs. I need two policy choices to finalize a decision-complete fix plan that matches your preferred output.

**Decision [question-prompt-render-format]:** For questionnaire prompts in captured notes (Claude + Codex), which render format should we standardize?
- Decision + options list (Recommended): Render one proposed decision line for the question plus a bullet list of all option labels and descriptions.
- Decision line only: Render only the proposed decision line for the question text without listing options.
- Inline compact: Render the question and options in one compact line without bullets.

**Decision [duplicate-assistant-dedupe-policy]:** When Codex emits identical same-turn assistant text as both agent_message and final_answer, how should notes handle it?
- Same-turn dedupe (Recommended): Keep one copy by suppressing the duplicate identical assistant line in that turn.
- Keep raw duplicates: Preserve both lines exactly as emitted by provider events.
- Drop Q&A confirmations: Remove questionnaire confirmation lines entirely, even if not duplicated.

**Decision [duplicate-assistant-dedupe-policy]:** When Codex emits identical same-turn assistant text as both agent_message and final_answer, how should notes handle it? -> Same-turn dedupe (Recommended)

**Creating detailed implementation plan**

</details>

I received both policy selections through the questionnaire tool, so the remaining implementation choices are now locked. I’m drafting the full decision-complete fix plan now with concrete parser/writer/test changes.

# User_unknown-time

PLEASE IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN:
## Fix Questionnaire Prompt/Options Capture + Duplicate Assistant Lines (Claude + Codex)

### Summary
Capture should include both:
1. The questionnaire prompt with all options, and
2. The accepted answer (single compact decision line, as already standardized).

Also remove duplicate assistant lines when Codex emits the same text as both `agent_message` and `final_answer` in the same turn.

Selected policies:
- Prompt rendering: `Decision + options list`
- Duplicate handling: `Same-turn dedupe`

### Important Interface / Type Changes
- No public API changes.
- No feature-flag default changes (`writerIncludeToolCalls` remains `false`).
- Internal event/render behavior changes only:
  1. Codex parser will synthesize questionnaire **proposed** `decision` events from `request_user_input` function calls.
  2. Markdown writer will render questionnaire proposed decisions with option lists.
  3. Markdown writer will dedupe identical same-turn assistant lines (prefer final over commentary when they are identical).

### Implementation Plan

1. Codex parser: synthesize questionnaire prompt decisions
- File: `apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts`
- In `response_item.function_call` handling for `name === "request_user_input"`:
  - Keep existing `tool.call` behavior unchanged.
  - Parse `questions` and emit one `decision` per question:
    - `status: "proposed"`
    - `decidedBy: "assistant"`
    - `summary: <question text>`
    - `metadata` includes:
      - `providerQuestionId` (question `id` when present; fallback deterministic key)
      - `header` (if present)
      - `options` (label + description)
      - `multiSelect` (if present)
    - `basisEventIds` references the related `tool.call` event.
- Decision key normalization:
  - Prefer question `id` when available for stable pairing with accepted decision.
  - Fallback to normalized question text/index.

2. Codex parser: make request-user-input mapping resume-safe across `fromOffset`
- File: `apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts`
- Parse/cache `request_user_input` `function_call` metadata regardless of `lineEnd > fromOffset`, while only **emitting** events when `lineEnd > fromOffset`.
- Process `function_call_output` bookkeeping (including pending-map delete) regardless of offset, but emit only when `lineEnd > fromOffset`.
- Result:
  - If call is before offset and output is after offset, accepted decision still gets question metadata (question text/options), not just raw question id.

3. Markdown writer: render questionnaire prompt options
- File: `apps/daemon/src/writer/markdown_writer.ts`
- For `decision` events with `status === "proposed"` and questionnaire metadata (`options` list):
  - Render:
    - `**Decision [key]:** <question summary>`
    - option bullets, one per option:
      - `- <label>: <description>` when description exists
      - `- <label>` when description is empty
  - Keep existing non-questionnaire decision rendering unchanged.
- Keep accepted questionnaire decision policy unchanged:
  - single compact decision line
  - no status sub-line.

4. Markdown writer: same-turn assistant duplicate suppression
- File: `apps/daemon/src/writer/markdown_writer.ts`
- Add same-turn duplicate logic for assistant messages:
  - If a commentary assistant message is immediately followed by a final assistant message in the same turn with identical normalized content, suppress the earlier commentary copy and keep the final copy.
  - Also suppress exact immediate assistant duplicates with same turn/content signature.
- Scope this dedupe to assistant message rendering only; do not affect user/system/tool/decision events.

5. Claude compatibility path
- No parser behavior change required for prompt synthesis (already emits proposed questionnaire decisions with options metadata).
- Validate that writer option rendering now surfaces Claude questionnaire options in notes.

### Test Cases and Scenarios

1. Codex prompt synthesis
- Input includes `response_item.function_call` `request_user_input`.
- Expected:
  - proposed `decision` emitted with question summary + options metadata.

2. Codex accepted answer with pre-offset call
- Parse with `fromOffset` between function_call and function_call_output.
- Expected:
  - accepted `decision` still maps to question text/options (not raw id-only fallback).

3. Writer prompt/options rendering
- Given proposed questionnaire decision with options metadata.
- Expected markdown includes:
  - one proposed decision line
  - all options rendered as bullets.

4. Writer accepted questionnaire rendering regression
- Given accepted questionnaire decision (`metadata.providerQuestionId`).
- Expected:
  - single decision line only
  - no status line.

5. Duplicate assistant line dedupe
- Given same-turn assistant commentary + final with identical content.
- Expected:
  - exactly one rendered assistant line (final-preferred behavior).

6. Claude regression
- Existing AskUserQuestion parse + writer render includes question prompt and options list; accepted answer remains compact.

7. Non-questionnaire decisions/messages regression
- Existing rendering and parser behavior unchanged.

### Assumptions and Defaults
- Questionnaire prompt/options should be represented via proposed `decision` events (not tool-call visibility changes).
- Duplicate suppression applies to note rendering only (does not alter stored raw provider logs).
- Historical notes are not backfilled; fix-forward only.

**Summarizing implementation and test results**

Implemented the plan exactly with these key changes:

1. The codex parser's function_call now caches irrespective of offset and emits proposed decisions including metadata and options.  
2. Function_call_output bookkeeping before offset uses providerQuestionId and supports options/multiselect.  
3. The legacy request_user_input path now emits proposed decisions and normalizes accepted keys, which may internally affect legacy underscore-to-hyphen formats.  
4. The markdown writer renders proposed questionnaire decisions as bullet lists with options, while accepted decisions remain single-line; assistant duplicate commentaries are deduplicated.  
5. Updated and added tests accordingly.

Reference changed files with example absolute paths:  
- [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:402)  
- [markdown_writer.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/writer/markdown_writer.ts:200)  

No changes were made to the openfeature default mode.

Test summary: Ran all tests with 36 passed.  
Test command used: `npm test`

Next steps suggestions:  
1. Run daemon capture tests to verify integration.  
2. Monitor legacy accepted decision key normalization impact on existing workflows.

Note: No public API changes were made. Legacy `request_user_input` accepted decision keys are now normalized, which could affect old outputs using underscores internally.

</details>

Implemented.

### What changed

- Updated Codex parser to synthesize **proposed questionnaire decisions** from `response_item.function_call` (`request_user_input`), including `providerQuestionId`, `header`, `options`, and `multiSelect` metadata, while keeping normal `tool.call` behavior intact:  
[parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:402)

- Made `request_user_input` mapping **resume-safe across `fromOffset`**:
  - caches `function_call` questionnaire metadata even before offset,
  - processes `function_call_output` bookkeeping before offset,
  - emits only when past offset.  
[parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:500)

- Kept accepted questionnaire answers as canonical accepted `decision` events, now with stable keying/metadata mapping (including resumed parses):  
[parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:541)

- Added same proposed-question synthesis to legacy Codex `request_user_input` parser path for consistency:  
[parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:662)

- Updated markdown rendering:
  - proposed questionnaire decisions render as:
    - `**Decision [key]:** ...`
    - option bullets (`- label: description`),
  - accepted questionnaire decisions remain single-line compact (no status line),
  - same-turn duplicate assistant lines are suppressed (commentary dropped when identical final follows; immediate same-turn assistant duplicates deduped).  
[markdown_writer.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/writer/markdown_writer.ts:200)

- No changes to feature-flag defaults (`writerIncludeToolCalls` remains `false`).

### Tests updated

- Codex parser coverage for:
  - proposed prompt synthesis with options,
  - accepted answer mapping with provider question id,
  - resume-offset metadata carryover,
  - malformed output fallback without accepted decision regression.  
[tests/codex-parser_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/codex-parser_test.ts:189)

- Claude parser regression to assert prompt options metadata still present:  
[tests/claude-parser_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/claude-parser_test.ts:195)

- Writer tests for:
  - proposed questionnaire option rendering,
  - accepted questionnaire compact rendering,
  - assistant duplicate suppression rules.  
[tests/writer-markdown_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/writer-markdown_test.ts:424)

### Verification run

Executed:

```sh
deno test --allow-read --allow-write tests/codex-parser_test.ts tests/claude-parser_test.ts tests/writer-markdown_test.ts
```

Result: `36 passed, 0 failed`.

If you want, I can now run a live `::capture` round and confirm the new note output shape end-to-end.
