A recent change (maybe the first-line one) caused changes in all the codex conversations. (You could see with git status). Basically it triggered reprocessing of all those files, and with the codex timestamping issue, all the timestamped headings got updated to now.

So we have to figure out how to not re-try processing. It might require persistent state. Also, we need to figure out how to get accurate timestamps for Codex conversation, and it seems like we'll have to capture full session snapshots. In cases where we don't have a good timestamp for the event, we shouldn't create one (i.e., now() as a fallback), and just omit them from the headings.

I've created a new task.2026.2026-02-25-persistent-state.md for us to flush out this ticket. What do you think?

# claude-haiku-4-5.20251001_2026-02-25_0826_55

I think this is exactly the right direction. The task file is currently just a shell, so let me break down what I see as the core issues and how your approach addresses them:

## The Problem

1. **Reprocessing without tracking**: Files are being reprocessed because there's no persistent record of which events have already been ingested/processed
2. **Timestamp fallback trap**: Using `now()` as a fallback for missing timestamps creates false timestamps that overwrite accurate ones on reprocessing
3. **No session snapshots for Codex**: Codex conversations lack the full context needed to extract accurate event timestamps

## Your Approach (which I think is solid)

1. **Persistent state** to track processed events
   - Could be a simple hash/set of processed event IDs or a last-processed timestamp per file
   - Should survive daemon restarts

2. **Capture full session snapshots** for Codex
   - Gets you the actual event timestamps from the source data
   - Avoids the guessing game entirely

3. **Omit timestamps when uncertain**
   - Much better than using `now()` — a missing timestamp is at least honest
   - Allows downstream consumers to handle missing data gracefully

## Questions to Flush Out in the Task

Before implementing, I'd suggest documenting:

- **Where should persistent state live?** (`~/.kato/` state file? daemon memory with periodic flush?)
- **What granularity?** Track by file path, by event ID, or by last-processed timestamp?
- **What triggers reprocessing?** (file modification time? explicit user flag? never after first ingest?)
- **Session snapshot capture strategy** — how do you invoke full snapshots for Codex conversations?
- **Backwards compat** — what about files already processed with `now()` timestamps?

Want me to help you flesh out the task file with these considerations, or would you rather run with a first implementation?

# User_2026-02-25_0849_17

Yes, two separate types of state: control state, which tracks recording-to-session mapping, intended recording state (so we can automatically pick up processing after daemon restarts), and the "last-processed" event ID; and session state, i.e., a serialization of the current in-memory conversation in our desired kato-specific representation, where we can write timestamps in realtime for Codex conversations that we're processing. This is a major rewrite. 

Yes, persistent state can live in ~/.kato. 

For granularity, eventIDs seems correct. We should probably record last-processed (by kato) timestamp too. 

Probably we need a daemon flag of cleanSessionStatesOnShutdown, as a security measure. 

We should process session state generation in order of reverse mtime? and only create new persistent session state for sessions with mtime greater than the daemon startup time... ? i.e., we don't want to have to create session state for all old session that don't have them yet, only active ones.

Any other questions?

reprocessing of session states should be manual. There's a question of which sessions should be processed. Probably not all, but if we don't process all codex states as they happen, we won't have any basis for accurate timestamping if we decide to record later. I guess we can set a preference per-provider-session-root (autoGenerateSnapshots) of whether to generate session state for all conversations. So we'll need an updated config schema. 

We don't need to worry about backwards compatibility. 

I'd expect you to have more questions.

# claude-haiku-4-5.20251001_2026-02-25_0849_35

Excellent framing. This is definitely a major rewrite but the separation of concerns is clean. I have quite a few questions:

**Critical design questions:**

1. **Control state structure**: Is this a single file (e.g., `~/.kato/control-state.json`) or per-recording/per-session? What does "recording-to-session mapping" look like — one-to-one or can one recording come from multiple sessions?

2. **Session state format & lifecycle**: 
   - What's the "kato-specific representation"? Structured JSON with events + timestamps?
   - When is session state created? On first event? Only when `autoGenerateSnapshots=true`?
   - If a session is still active and we're writing to it in realtime, how do we handle concurrent reads (e.g., export queries)?
   - Is session state *always* "live" or does it get finalized when a session ends?

3. **Event ID semantics**:
   - Who generates event IDs and how do we ensure they're stable/deterministic across daemon restarts (so reprocessing doesn't generate new IDs)?
   - Is an event ID unique per session, or globally across all provider sessions?

4. **Last-processed tracking**: Per-recording, per-session, or global? If we have multiple recordings from the same session, do they share a last-processed cursor?

5. **Recording state lifecycle**: What are the valid states for "intended recording state"? (`pending` → `in_progress` → `completed`? with `failed`?) How do we recover mid-stream if a daemon crashes?

6. **Codex timestamp capture**: When you say "write timestamps in realtime for Codex conversations", are these:
   - Sourced from Codex API metadata (most accurate)?
   - Captured when kato receives the event?
   - Some blend (e.g., API timestamp if available, else receive time)?

7. **cleanSessionStatesOnShutdown scope**: Does this mean:
   - Delete all session state files?
   - Or just flush in-memory buffers?
   - Or conditional cleanup (only for "open" sessions)?
   - Should this also apply to control state, or just session state?

**Secondary but important:**

8. **Config schema for autoGenerateSnapshots**: Is this per `providerSessionRoot` or global default + per-root override?

9. **Old sessions without state**: If we only create session state for mtime > daemon startup, and a user exports a recording from an old session, what happens? Do we synthesize state on-demand?

Which of these would you like to lock down first?

# User_2026-02-25_1114_29

Let's discuss. 

::capture documentation/notes/task.2026.2026-02-25-persistent-state.md

1. Maybe we want both a daemon-level control state and per-session? Session control states could keep track of multiple recordings. I'd like to support multiple recordings per session, but it's session->recordings... a recording couldn't have multiple sessions; it's just that a session could have multiple recordings. And then the daemon control state could link to multiple session control states? Separation would be good in the case that we go multi-threaded, to avoid contention over a single file.

2. I think the kato-specific representation could be jsonl list of events (with timestamps). Session state is created either"
- when autoGenerateSnapshots is true: daemon detects a file modification
- when autoGenerateSnapshots is false: only when a recording is first triggered. 
Does that make sense? Why would concurrent reads be a problem?
A session could always come back to life, but we should have a clean command that removes the session state file and then if autoGenerateSnapshots is false, new session activity wouldn't automatically cause it to be recreated.

3. The only way I can think of to generate event IDs deterministically is to use a hash of the content+sessionID. But maybe we don't need IDs? We could just use line numbers? If we need IDs, then content+sessionID hash is effectively unique globally.

4. Last-processed is per-recording. Multiple recordings should each have their own  last-processed cursor.

5. For recording state, could we just simplify it to "on" or "off", and then depend on the cursor for crash recovery?

6. If by Codex API metadata you mean make a network call, definitely no. I was thinking, yes, if the event comes from a "live" read, use kato's time; If kato is back-processing, do not record a timestamp.

7. cleanSessionStatesOnShutdown  means, yes, delete all session state files. control state is probably safe to persist. The idea here is, some users might not want copies of their conversations hanging around. This means that when the daemon starts again and scoped activity is detected in codex logs, there will be no timestamps for older events. But in "record" situations (as opposed to capture), that might not matter.

8. Yes, autoGenerateSnapshots should have a global setting (maybe globalAutoGenerateSnapshots, probably default or not specified is false) as well as allowing override by providerSessionRoot. Maybe when we "init" a new config file, we can do an interactive prompt to make sure people understand the security implications. 

9. If there is an old session, there would no need to create a session state? If cleanSessionStatesOnShutdown happened, there is no session state to export. But maybe we should have a way to create a new session state on the CLI in addition to that triggered by mtime detection or recording trigger.

## Implementation Status (2026-02-26)

- [x] Added persistent daemon/session state artifacts under `~/.kato`:
      `daemon-control.json`, `sessions/*.meta.json`, `sessions/*.twin.jsonl`.
- [x] Added SessionTwin contracts and mapper aligned with canonical kinds in
      `dev.event-kinds.md`.
- [x] Persisted provider ingest cursors across restarts.
- [x] Persisted session recording state and per-recording write cursors across restarts.
- [x] Wired in-chat command semantics for persistent recordings:
      `::start`, `::capture`, `::stop`, `::stop id:<prefix>`, `::stop dest:<path>`,
      and ambiguous bare `::stop <arg>` union behavior.
- [x] Moved `cleanSessionStatesOnShutdown` cleanup to shutdown timing.
- [x] Added Gemini cursor-anchor realignment and replay-from-start fallback when
      anchors are missing.
- [x] Hardened startup migration behavior with explicit fail-closed handling for
      invalid/unsupported session metadata.
- [x] Added SessionTwin golden tests across Claude/Codex/Gemini fixtures.
- [x] Added runtime E2E-style coverage for multi-recording cursor independence,
      ambiguous `::stop`, and default destination behavior.
- [x] Fixed symlink-escape path policy coverage and verified deny behavior.
- [x] Updated persistence docs in `README.md` and `documentation/notes/dev.*` notes.
- [x] Validation: `deno test -A` passes (`213 passed, 0 failed`).
- [x] Follow-up: add dedicated clean command wiring for persisted twin cleanup
      (`clean --twins`, plus optional metadata deletion) with running-daemon
      safety.
- [x] Follow-up: add explicit daemon startup handshake/ack to remove optimistic
      running-status writes before daemon confirmation.

## Post-review Refinements (2026-02-26)

- [x] Extracted duplicated `readOptionalEnv` / `resolveHomeDir` helpers into
      shared daemon utility module (`apps/daemon/src/utils/env.ts`) and removed
      local duplicates.
- [x] Replaced large raw SessionTwin fingerprint payload strings with compact
      hashed fingerprints (`FNV-1a`) persisted in session metadata.
- [x] Avoided full twin replay on each ingestion cycle when an in-memory snapshot
      exists by merging only appended twin events into the snapshot.
- [x] Removed redundant `MutableSessionMetadata` alias in daemon runtime.
- [x] Aligned provider auto-generate-snapshot typing to shared
      `ProviderAutoGenerateSnapshots` contract.
