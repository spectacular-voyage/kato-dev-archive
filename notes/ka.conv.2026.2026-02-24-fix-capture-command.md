# User_2026-02-24_1345_17

Claude Code has implemented [task.2026.2026-02-24-broader-message-capture.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-24-broader-message-capture.md). I tried out a capture command for the conversation (see [conv.2026.2026-02-22-claude-stenobot-codebase-analysis.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-22-claude-stenobot-codebase-analysis.md) but it only captured the end I think? the capture command should capture everything from the beginning of the conversation.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-24_1345_21

I’m going to trace the message-capture implementation against the task doc and your conversation example, then reproduce why only the tail is captured. I’ll inspect the relevant daemon code and notes first, then patch and verify the capture range behavior.

# User_2026-02-24_1348_50

What are snapshots?

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-24_1349_13

In Kato, a “snapshot” means a point-in-time state object.

1. Session snapshot: one conversation session’s runtime state (`provider`, `sessionId`, `cursor`, `events`, schema version, metadata).  
[ingestion_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:10)

2. Daemon status snapshot: overall daemon health/state (`daemonRunning`, `providers`, `recordings`, heartbeat timestamps), persisted for CLI/status.  
[status.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/shared/src/contracts/status.ts:12)  
[control_plane.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/control_plane.ts:217)

For your capture issue specifically, `::capture` uses session snapshot events, and the in-memory session snapshot currently keeps a bounded event window (`maxEventsPerSession`, default `200`).  
[ingestion_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:51)

# User_2026-02-24_1351_02

So ConversationEvents are all written into the snapshot? That seems a little redundant. It might be better to just have session metadata and read actual ConversationEvents as needed?

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-24_1351_37

Yes. Today a runtime session snapshot stores `events` plus metadata/cursor, not just metadata.  
[ingestion_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:10)

That does look redundant versus provider log files, but it’s currently the daemon’s canonical working state for:

1. Incremental dedupe/merge during ingestion.  
[provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:707)

2. In-chat command handling (`::capture`, `::record`) against event history.  
[daemon_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:365)

3. Export loading (`snapshot.events`).  
[main.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/main.ts:134)

Important detail: it’s already bounded (default `maxEventsPerSession = 200`), so it’s a retained window, not guaranteed full history.  
[ingestion_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:51)

So your instinct is valid. The better long-term shape is likely hybrid: metadata + cursor + small tail in memory, and a separate canonical event log/index for full-history reads on demand. If you want, I can sketch or implement that refactor path.

# User_2026-02-24_1353_14

How many events in that latest Claude Code conversation?

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-24_1353_41

I’m going to read the most recently modified Claude session log under `~/.claude/projects` and count canonical `ConversationEvent`s using Kato’s Claude parser, so the number matches how Kato sees events.

Latest Claude Code conversation (most recently modified session file) has **422 events**.

Source file: [024f2b92-ff3f-492d-9198-e2fb2606b3aa.jsonl](/home/djradon/.claude/projects/-home-djradon-hub-spectacular-voyage-kato/024f2b92-ff3f-492d-9198-e2fb2606b3aa.jsonl)

Breakdown:
- `message.assistant`: 59
- `message.user`: 2
- `thinking`: 33
- `tool.call`: 164
- `tool.result`: 164

# User_2026-02-24_1402_41

Clearly 200 is not an adequate default. Guessing session snapshot are only held in memory? 

For the "separate canonical event log" for full history, can we just use the original file?

It hints at a bigger issue: can we record or capture to more than one location at a time. Seems like that could be nice (and would require session per recording? so we might have to invent a new type. But I'd want stop to stop all recordings. 

Also have to decide about persisting state acros daemon restarts... do we automatically pick up conversations.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-24_1403_58

Yes, your read is correct.

1. Snapshot storage today
- `maxEventsPerSession` default is `200`, so older events are dropped from the in-memory window.  
[ingestion_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:51)  
[ingestion_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:125)
- Session snapshots are memory-only (`Map` in `InMemorySessionSnapshotStore`) and recreated on daemon start.  
[ingestion_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:115)  
[main.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/main.ts:101)

2. Using original provider files as canonical full history
- Yes, that is a good direction for full-history `capture`/`export`.
- Current runtime exports from `snapshot.events`, not raw files.  
[main.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/main.ts:134)
- So we’d need a history loader that resolves `sessionId -> source file` and reparses on demand.

3. Multi-destination recording
- Today it is single active destination per `(provider, sessionId)` (`Map<string, ActiveRecording>`).  
[recording_pipeline.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/writer/recording_pipeline.ts:158)  
[recording_pipeline.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/writer/recording_pipeline.ts:194)
- `::stop` currently stops that one active recording for the session.  
[daemon_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:289)
- If you want fan-out recording, we should change to `session -> set of destinations`, and keep `::stop` as “stop all destinations for this session.”

4. Restart behavior
- Conversations are automatically rediscovered/reparsed after restart.  
[provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:476)  
[provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:629)
- Active recording state is not persisted, so recordings do not auto-resume.
- Existing historical command events are not replayed on startup pass.  
[daemon_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:369)

1. If you want, I can implement a concrete first step: full-history `capture/export` from source files (while keeping in-memory snapshots as hot cache).  
2. Then a second step: multi-destination recording with `::stop` stopping all active destinations for that session.

# User_2026-02-24_1411_10

What are the downsides of not keeping the full snapshot in memory and using the original file as canonical? We'd need to reparse the file on every capture request. Doesn't seem horrible. What else?

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-24_1411_44

You’re right that reparsing on `capture` can be fine, especially for MVP. Main downsides beyond raw parse time:

1. Command-time correctness gets trickier. `::capture` means “up to this command event,” and current flow uses an in-memory slice to enforce that boundary cleanly. Without it, you must reparse only up to the command cursor/offset or you may include later turns.  
[daemon_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:226)

2. Higher tail latency and I/O spikes on long sessions. A few large files can make capture/export slower and noisier than hot-memory reads.

3. More contention with actively written files. You need careful handling of partial writes, truncation, and rotation while parsing.  
[provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:643)

4. History becomes dependent on parser version. Re-exporting old raw files with a newer parser can change output semantics over time.

5. Less resilience if source files disappear or become unreadable (permissions, moves, cleanup). In-memory/persisted normalized events can still serve exports in those cases.

6. More provider-coupling in core paths. SessionId→file resolution and provider quirks become critical for every capture/export path.  
[provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:553)

7. Repeated work for multi-destination capture/recording. If you fan out outputs, reparsing per destination is wasteful unless you add a parse cache.

So yes: “original file as canonical” is viable, but it usually pushes you toward a hybrid: small in-memory tail for hot runtime semantics + on-demand full parse (or persisted normalized event log) for full-history exports.

# User_2026-02-24_1412_03

::capture /home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-24-fix-capture-command.md

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-24_1412_29

Ignoring that line as a Kato control command (`::capture`), per [dev.general-guidance.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/dev.general-guidance.md:105).

If you want me to handle capture directly in this chat (instead of ignoring control lines), say that explicitly and I’ll do it.

# User_2026-02-24_1416_04

Capture is supposed to mean "from the beginning, and continue through this event until a stop is encountered"

I think the session snapshot approach is better IF it doesn't result in ridiculous memory requirements. I guess we can evict stale session snapshots if needed. What do you estimate memory usage would be for, say, ten 400-event snapshots.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-24_1417_49

For your exact scenario (`10` sessions x `400` events), a practical estimate is **~15–20 MB total runtime overhead** for snapshots + command-tracking state, based on your current event mix.

Measured against your latest Claude session data:

1. Event payload baseline
- Parsed events average: **~2.1 KB/event** (JSON bytes)
- `4000` events total serialized size: **~8.5 MB**

2. In-memory snapshot cost (empirical)
- `10 x 400` snapshot objects: **~13–14 MB heapUsed delta**
- RSS delta observed: **~20–23 MB**

3. Extra runtime state
- `seenEventSignatures` tracking adds roughly **~1–2 MB** in this scale

So the all-in practical number is around **15–20 MB** for that workload.

Caveat: this is very linear with `tool.result` size. If event content gets much larger (big command outputs), memory can jump fast. So eviction of stale sessions is still a good idea, even if you raise the default from `200`.

# User_2026-02-24_1420_45

Even at 50MB or 100MB, that's not excessive by modern application standards. We can juggle sessions out of memory as they become stale, so I think we could have an extremely high default, like 10000

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-24_1421_15

Agreed on memory: `10000` is defensible if we add guardrails.

Main caveat is not just RAM, it’s CPU in current loops:

1. Per-poll full re-scan of snapshot events for command processing (`map + Set + for` over all events).  
[daemon_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:365)

2. Per-ingest dedupe rebuild over existing events.  
[provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:707)

Using your measured event mix, rough sizing is about **~4 KB/event in runtime state** (events + signature tracking).  
So `10000` events is roughly **~40 MB per active session**.  
That means:
- 1 active session: ~40 MB
- 3 active sessions: ~120 MB
- 10 active sessions: ~400 MB

So yes, `10000` can work, but I’d pair it with:

1. `maxEventsPerSession = 10000`
2. Global memory/bytes budget (evict least-recently-updated sessions when over budget)
3. TTL/staleness eviction for idle sessions
4. Incremental command processing (process only new suffix events, not full snapshot every poll)

If you want, I can implement this in that order.

# User_2026-02-24_1426_17

Can you write a task for it to /home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-24-memory-management.md -- note that I added an item for the [task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md) to keep track of "- performance data like memory use, maybe with OpenTelemetry". OpenTelemetry might be overkill, but it could be useful with Sentry support? 

We'll need settings for "max memory" and a no-op setting for "how long before a session is evicted"

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-24_1427_39

Added the full task spec to [task.2026.2026-02-24-memory-management.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-24-memory-management.md).

It now includes:

- Memory-management goal/scope tied to the improved-status perf item.
- Default retention change to `maxEventsPerSession: 10000`.
- New config settings:
  - `snapshotMaxMemoryMb`
  - `snapshotSessionEvictionIdleMs` (explicitly wired as no-op for now)
- Status/perf telemetry requirements (local status/logs required, OTel optional, Sentry bridge path noted).
- Implementation steps, tests, acceptance criteria, and open questions.

# User_2026-02-24_1449_00

Review the six open tasks (task.*), and let me know which we should work on next. I'm eager to get gemini working so I can start using it for development. ;)

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-24_1450_13

Work on **Gemini provider next**.

Reason: it is the only open task that directly unlocks your immediate goal (“start using Gemini for development”), while the others are infrastructure/quality improvements.

Priority order I recommend:

1. **Gemini provider (next now)**  
[task.2026.2026-02-22-gemini-provider.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-gemini-provider.md:10)  
This note is currently mostly research/context, not a full implementation checklist yet.

2. **Memory management (immediately after Gemini MVP)**  
[task.2026.2026-02-24-memory-management.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-24-memory-management.md:46)  
Raises retention (`10000`) + adds budget controls; important for long-session capture correctness.

3. **Improved status**  
[task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md:25)  
Great operator UX, but not blocking Gemini ingestion/export.

4. **Better targeting**  
[task.2026.2026-02-24-better-targeting.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-24-better-targeting.md:9)  
Currently underspecified (one-line goal), so not ready before fleshing out.

5. **Awesome logging**  
[task.2026.2026-02-23-awesome-logging.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-23-awesome-logging.md:31)

6. **CI/CD hardening**  
[task.2026.2026-02-22-ci-cd.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-ci-cd.md:201)

If you want, I can start immediately by rewriting the Gemini task into a concrete execution checklist and then implementing it end-to-end.

# User_2026-02-24_1450_51

yes please

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-24_1504_30

Gemini provider support is implemented end-to-end.

- Added `providerSessionRoots.gemini` to config contracts/defaults and env wiring (`KATO_GEMINI_SESSION_ROOTS`) in [config.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/shared/src/contracts/config.ts:14) and [runtime_config.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/config/runtime_config.ts:179).
- Added Gemini parser with `item-index` cursors, `displayContent` preference, tool/thinking extraction, and `info` skip in [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/gemini/parser.ts:190).
- Added Gemini ingestion discovery/runner (`session-*.json`), factory registration, and cursor handling for non-byte cursors in [provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:909).
- Wired daemon launch/runtime path so Gemini roots are included in read scope and startup runner config in [launcher.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/launcher.ts:40), [main.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/main.ts:106), and [router.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts:226).
- Added tests + fixture: [gemini-parser_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/gemini-parser_test.ts:1), [provider-ingestion_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/provider-ingestion_test.ts:470), [gemini-session.json](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/fixtures/gemini-session.json), and updated launcher/config/CLI tests.
- Rewrote the Gemini task note into a concrete checklist/status in [task.2026.2026-02-22-gemini-provider.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-gemini-provider.md:9).

Validation run:
- `deno check main.ts main_test.ts apps/**/*.ts shared/**/*.ts tests/**/*.ts` passed.
- `deno test --allow-read --allow-write=.kato tests/runtime-config_test.ts tests/daemon-launcher_test.ts tests/daemon-main_test.ts tests/daemon-cli_test.ts tests/provider-ingestion_test.ts tests/gemini-parser_test.ts tests/fixtures_port_test.ts` passed (`51 passed, 0 failed`).

Next steps:
1. Restart daemon and confirm Gemini sessions appear in `kato status --json`.
2. If you want, I can move this task note to a `completed.*` note and open a follow-up for Gemini workspace-root targeting.

What are snapshots?

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Explaining runtime and status snapshots**

</details>

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

You’re asking about “snapshots” in Kato terminology, so I’ll answer directly from the runtime contracts and distinguish the two snapshot types (`session` vs `status`).

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Summarizing snapshot distinctions**

</details>

In Kato, a “snapshot” means a point-in-time state object.

1. Session snapshot: one conversation session’s runtime state (`provider`, `sessionId`, `cursor`, `events`, schema version, metadata).  
[ingestion_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:10)

2. Daemon status snapshot: overall daemon health/state (`daemonRunning`, `providers`, `recordings`, heartbeat timestamps), persisted for CLI/status.  
[status.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/shared/src/contracts/status.ts:12)  
[control_plane.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/control_plane.ts:217)

For your capture issue specifically, `::capture` uses session snapshot events, and the in-memory session snapshot currently keeps a bounded event window (`maxEventsPerSession`, default `200`).  
[ingestion_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:51)

# User_unknown-time

So ConversationEvents are all written into the snapshot? That seems a little redundant. It might be better to just have session metadata and read actual ConversationEvents as needed?

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Analyzing event storage tradeoffs**

</details>

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

You’re pushing on the right tradeoff. I’ll map exactly what snapshots are used for today and where metadata-only would help or hurt, then give a concrete recommendation for Kato.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Explaining snapshot event design**

</details>

Yes. Today a runtime session snapshot stores `events` plus metadata/cursor, not just metadata.  
[ingestion_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:10)

That does look redundant versus provider log files, but it’s currently the daemon’s canonical working state for:

1. Incremental dedupe/merge during ingestion.  
[provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:707)

2. In-chat command handling (`::capture`, `::record`) against event history.  
[daemon_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:365)

3. Export loading (`snapshot.events`).  
[main.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/main.ts:134)

Important detail: it’s already bounded (default `maxEventsPerSession = 200`), so it’s a retained window, not guaranteed full history.  
[ingestion_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:51)

So your instinct is valid. The better long-term shape is likely hybrid: metadata + cursor + small tail in memory, and a separate canonical event log/index for full-history reads on demand. If you want, I can sketch or implement that refactor path.

# User_unknown-time

Clearly 200 is not an adequate default. Guessing session snapshot are only held in memory? 

For the "separate canonical event log" for full history, can we just use the original file?

It hints at a bigger issue: can we record or capture to more than one location at a time. Seems like that could be nice (and would require session per recording? so we might have to invent a new type. But I'd want stop to stop all recordings. 

Also have to decide about persisting state acros daemon restarts... do we automatically pick up conversations.

**Summarizing session event handling and recording design**

</details>

Yes, your read is correct.

1. Snapshot storage today
- `maxEventsPerSession` default is `200`, so older events are dropped from the in-memory window.  
[ingestion_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:51)  
[ingestion_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:125)
- Session snapshots are memory-only (`Map` in `InMemorySessionSnapshotStore`) and recreated on daemon start.  
[ingestion_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:115)  
[main.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/main.ts:101)

2. Using original provider files as canonical full history
- Yes, that is a good direction for full-history `capture`/`export`.
- Current runtime exports from `snapshot.events`, not raw files.  
[main.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/main.ts:134)
- So we’d need a history loader that resolves `sessionId -> source file` and reparses on demand.

3. Multi-destination recording
- Today it is single active destination per `(provider, sessionId)` (`Map<string, ActiveRecording>`).  
[recording_pipeline.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/writer/recording_pipeline.ts:158)  
[recording_pipeline.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/writer/recording_pipeline.ts:194)
- `::stop` currently stops that one active recording for the session.  
[daemon_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:289)
- If you want fan-out recording, we should change to `session -> set of destinations`, and keep `::stop` as “stop all destinations for this session.”

4. Restart behavior
- Conversations are automatically rediscovered/reparsed after restart.  
[provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:476)  
[provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:629)
- Active recording state is not persisted, so recordings do not auto-resume.
- Existing historical command events are not replayed on startup pass.  
[daemon_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:369)

1. If you want, I can implement a concrete first step: full-history `capture/export` from source files (while keeping in-memory snapshots as hot cache).  
2. Then a second step: multi-destination recording with `::stop` stopping all active destinations for that session.

# User_unknown-time

What are the downsides of not keeping the full snapshot in memory and using the original file as canonical? We'd need to reparse the file on every capture request. Doesn't seem horrible. What else?

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Listing downsides of no full snapshot**

</details>

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

You’re right that reparsing on `capture` can be fine, especially for MVP. Main downsides beyond raw parse time:

1. Command-time correctness gets trickier. `::capture` means “up to this command event,” and current flow uses an in-memory slice to enforce that boundary cleanly. Without it, you must reparse only up to the command cursor/offset or you may include later turns.  
[daemon_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:226)

2. Higher tail latency and I/O spikes on long sessions. A few large files can make capture/export slower and noisier than hot-memory reads.

3. More contention with actively written files. You need careful handling of partial writes, truncation, and rotation while parsing.  
[provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:643)

4. History becomes dependent on parser version. Re-exporting old raw files with a newer parser can change output semantics over time.

5. Less resilience if source files disappear or become unreadable (permissions, moves, cleanup). In-memory/persisted normalized events can still serve exports in those cases.

6. More provider-coupling in core paths. SessionId→file resolution and provider quirks become critical for every capture/export path.  
[provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:553)

7. Repeated work for multi-destination capture/recording. If you fan out outputs, reparsing per destination is wasteful unless you add a parse cache.

So yes: “original file as canonical” is viable, but it usually pushes you toward a hybrid: small in-memory tail for hot runtime semantics + on-demand full parse (or persisted normalized event log) for full-history exports.

Ignoring that line as a Kato control command (`::capture`), per [dev.general-guidance.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/dev.general-guidance.md:105).

# User_unknown-time

Capture is supposed to mean "from the beginning, and continue through this event until a stop is encountered"

I think the session snapshot approach is better IF it doesn't result in ridiculous memory requirements. I guess we can evict stale session snapshots if needed. What do you estimate memory usage would be for, say, ten 400-event snapshots.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Estimating memory usage range**

</details>

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

I’ll compute a data-based estimate from a real parsed session (event-size distribution), then extrapolate to `10 x 400` events with a realistic JS-object overhead range.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Planning memory usage measurement**

I have concrete per-event size stats now; I’m running one quick in-process memory experiment to estimate actual heap impact for `10 x 400` events (not just JSON byte size).

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Adjusting signature uniqueness to avoid deduplication**

<details>

**Assessing heap usage with unique cloned events**

</details>

I also want an upper-bound estimate where each session has distinct string payloads (no string reuse optimizations), since real sessions differ; I’m running that now.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Summarizing memory usage estimates**

</details>

For your exact scenario (`10` sessions x `400` events), a practical estimate is **~15–20 MB total runtime overhead** for snapshots + command-tracking state, based on your current event mix.

Measured against your latest Claude session data:

1. Event payload baseline
- Parsed events average: **~2.1 KB/event** (JSON bytes)
- `4000` events total serialized size: **~8.5 MB**

2. In-memory snapshot cost (empirical)
- `10 x 400` snapshot objects: **~13–14 MB heapUsed delta**
- RSS delta observed: **~20–23 MB**

3. Extra runtime state
- `seenEventSignatures` tracking adds roughly **~1–2 MB** in this scale

So the all-in practical number is around **15–20 MB** for that workload.

Caveat: this is very linear with `tool.result` size. If event content gets much larger (big command outputs), memory can jump fast. So eviction of stale sessions is still a good idea, even if you raise the default from `200`.

# User_unknown-time

Even at 50MB or 100MB, that's not excessive by modern application standards. We can juggle sessions out of memory as they become stale, so I think we could have an extremely high default, like 10000

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Evaluating high default event cap**

</details>

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

Agreed on memory: `10000` is defensible if we add guardrails.

Main caveat is not just RAM, it’s CPU in current loops:

1. Per-poll full re-scan of snapshot events for command processing (`map + Set + for` over all events).  
[daemon_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:365)

2. Per-ingest dedupe rebuild over existing events.  
[provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:707)

Using your measured event mix, rough sizing is about **~4 KB/event in runtime state** (events + signature tracking).  
So `10000` events is roughly **~40 MB per active session**.  
That means:
- 1 active session: ~40 MB
- 3 active sessions: ~120 MB
- 10 active sessions: ~400 MB

So yes, `10000` can work, but I’d pair it with:

1. `maxEventsPerSession = 10000`
2. Global memory/bytes budget (evict least-recently-updated sessions when over budget)
3. TTL/staleness eviction for idle sessions
4. Incremental command processing (process only new suffix events, not full snapshot every poll)

If you want, I can implement this in that order.

This note is currently mostly research/context, not a full implementation checklist yet.

2. **Memory management (immediately after Gemini MVP)**

Raises retention (`10000`) + adds budget controls; important for long-session capture correctness.

3. **Improved status**  
[task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md:25)  
Great operator UX, but not blocking Gemini ingestion/export.

4. **Better targeting**

**Summarizing Gemini provider wiring and next steps**

</details>

Gemini provider support is implemented end-to-end.

- Added `providerSessionRoots.gemini` to config contracts/defaults and env wiring (`KATO_GEMINI_SESSION_ROOTS`) in [config.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/shared/src/contracts/config.ts:14) and [runtime_config.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/config/runtime_config.ts:179).
- Added Gemini parser with `item-index` cursors, `displayContent` preference, tool/thinking extraction, and `info` skip in [parser.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/providers/gemini/parser.ts:190).
- Added Gemini ingestion discovery/runner (`session-*.json`), factory registration, and cursor handling for non-byte cursors in [provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:909).
- Wired daemon launch/runtime path so Gemini roots are included in read scope and startup runner config in [launcher.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/launcher.ts:40), [main.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/main.ts:106), and [router.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts:226).
- Added tests + fixture: [gemini-parser_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/gemini-parser_test.ts:1), [provider-ingestion_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/provider-ingestion_test.ts:470), [gemini-session.json](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/fixtures/gemini-session.json), and updated launcher/config/CLI tests.
- Rewrote the Gemini task note into a concrete checklist/status in [task.2026.2026-02-22-gemini-provider.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-gemini-provider.md:9).

Validation run:
- `deno check main.ts main_test.ts apps/**/*.ts shared/**/*.ts tests/**/*.ts` passed.
- `deno test --allow-read --allow-write=.kato tests/runtime-config_test.ts tests/daemon-launcher_test.ts tests/daemon-main_test.ts tests/daemon-cli_test.ts tests/provider-ingestion_test.ts tests/gemini-parser_test.ts tests/fixtures_port_test.ts` passed (`51 passed, 0 failed`).

Next steps:
1. Restart daemon and confirm Gemini sessions appear in `kato status --json`.
2. If you want, I can move this task note to a `completed.*` note and open a follow-up for Gemini workspace-root targeting.

# User_unknown-time

which task next? is memory management a pre-req for including memory in status?

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

I’ll quickly scan the current `task.*` notes and recommend the next one based on unblock value, then answer whether memory management is required before memory-in-status.

**Recommending next task ordering**

</details>

Next task should be `task.2026.2026-02-24-memory-management`.

Reason: it fixes the current capture-risk (`maxEventsPerSession` too low), adds bounded retention, and gives you the memory signals that status should report.

`memory management` is not a strict prereq for **all** memory-in-status:

1. `No` prereq for process memory (`rss`, `heapUsed`, `heapTotal`) in status.
2. `Yes` prereq for snapshot-memory metrics (estimated snapshot bytes, budget, evictions, idle-eviction config visibility), because those require store-level accounting/eviction logic.

Recommended order:
1. Memory management
2. Improved status
3. Better targeting

# User_unknown-time

Let's turn [task.2026.2026-02-24-memory-management.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-24-memory-management.md) into a real task note with checkboxes, that I can hand to Gemini. It's not so much a "implementation follow-on" as a prereq, and I'm not sure it captures everything we'll need for the status task. 

Instead of snapshotMaxMemoryMb, I changed to  daemonMaxMemoryMb, that gives us more flexibility but controls what's important. Do Deno processes have access to their own memory use?

Maybe we don't need an Idle Eviction setting? If we implement, we could set it to a high value. But what's the point? Security/Privacy?

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Preparing to update task note**

</details>

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

I’ll rewrite that note into an execution-ready spec with explicit checkboxes, dependencies for status, and your renamed `daemonMaxMemoryMb` setting. I’m reading the current task and status note first so the checklist is complete.

<details>

**Drafting detailed task note**

</details>

I’m going to rewrite this note as a handoff-ready implementation spec (checkboxes + dependency framing), and I’ll verify the exact Deno memory API fields so we can lock the status requirements precisely.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Planning comprehensive patch note**

</details>

I have what I need. I’m now patching the memory task note to: make it an explicit prerequisite for `improved-status`, switch fully to `daemonMaxMemoryMb`, and remove idle-eviction from scope (deferred).

**Finalizing concise status update**

</details>

Updated the task note into a handoff-ready checklist and reframed it as a prerequisite for status:

- [task.2026.2026-02-24-memory-management.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-24-memory-management.md)

Key changes made:

- Explicitly marked as prereq for `improved-status`.
- Fully switched to `daemonMaxMemoryMb` (default `200`).
- Added concrete implementation checklists (contracts, store, status model, logging, tests).
- Added required status memory fields so status work is unblocked.
- Removed idle eviction from scope (deferred).

Answers:

- Yes, Deno can read its own memory usage via `Deno.memoryUsage()`. It returns fields including `rss`, `heapTotal`, `heapUsed`, and `external`.
- Idle eviction is not required for this phase. Its main value is operational (cleaning up stale sessions in long-running daemons) and secondarily privacy/data-minimization. It is not a primary security control.

If you want, I can also update `task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md` to explicitly depend on this task’s new memory fields so Gemini has a strict sequencing contract.

# User_unknown-time

**Updating task dependency and formatting**

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

I’ll patch the status task note to make the memory-management dependency explicit and reference the required memory fields that must exist before status UX work proceeds.

**Finalizing concise summary format**

Updated as requested: [task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md)

What I changed:

- Added an explicit **Dependency** section pointing to memory management.
- Listed the exact prerequisite memory fields (`status.memory.*` and `daemonMaxMemoryMb`).
- Added a dedicated **Memory Visibility** requirement.
- Added a **Dependency gate** step in implementation.
- Added memory-specific tests and acceptance criteria so status work clearly consumes the prereq outputs.
