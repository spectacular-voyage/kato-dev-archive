test refactor continues

::capture-k

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2315_53

I’m treating this as a continuation of the test refactor work and I’ll re-establish context from the repo state first: current changes, recent test-related files, and any obvious failing targets.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2316_01

I’ve confirmed there are no code changes in the worktree beyond a new conversation note. Next I’m reading the latest test-refactor note and the standing task doc to recover the exact next slice instead of guessing.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2316_08

The task doc confirms this workstream already landed several direct-test extractions. I’m locating the still-open checklist items and the next heavy suite seam so I can continue the refactor on the intended path rather than inventing a new one.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2316_15

I have the continuation point: the last verified slice ended with `daemon_runtime`/`provider_ingestion` as the next source-level extraction candidates. I’m inspecting the command-boundary and seed-event logic inside `daemon_runtime.ts` first, because that matches the task note and is likely the highest-ROI remaining seam.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2316_33

The remaining logic is narrower than I expected: command-cursor anchor resolution and command seed slicing are still pure helper code inside `daemon_runtime.ts`, and the broad runtime suite still owns both behaviors. I’m mapping the exact call sites now so I can extract just that policy without dragging runtime loop orchestration along with it.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2317_48

I’ve got the seam and I’m moving to edits now: extract the pure command-state helpers into their own runtime module, add direct tests for boundary slicing and cursor-anchor behavior, then trim the now-redundant `daemon-runtime_test.ts` cases.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2320_04

The extraction is in. I’m checking the resulting source and test files for type/import drift before I run format and tests, because the main risk here is a small compile issue from moving pure helpers out of `daemon_runtime.ts`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2320_15

The code shape looks coherent. I’m formatting the touched files now, then I’ll run focused tests against the new helper file and the trimmed runtime suite before doing a repo-wide test pass.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2320_24

Lint is clean. The focused test run is still in flight; I’m polling that now, and if it stays green I’ll move straight to the full `deno task test --frozen` verification.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2320_31

The first focused run found two real leftovers: one fallback path in `daemon_runtime.ts` still referenced the old local slicing helpers, and the new direct test needed an explicit user-event narrowing. I’m patching those now and rerunning the same focused verification.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2320_53

The focused slice is clean: the new direct helper tests pass, the trimmed `daemon-runtime_test.ts` still passes, and lint is still clean. I’m running the full repo test task now so this lands as a verified refactor slice rather than a local-only cleanup.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2320_59

The full suite is running clean through type-check so far. I’m waiting on completion; if it stays green, I’ll close the loop with the final verified status and changed files.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2321_07

The repo-wide test task passed on the new slice: `494` tests, all green. I’m doing one last worktree check now so the close-out is precise about what changed and what’s still untracked but untouched by me.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2321_24

Extracted the next `daemon_runtime` refactor seam into [runtime_command_state.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/runtime_command_state.ts). That module now owns command-cursor anchor resolution, boundary segmentation, boundary snapshot slicing, and seed-event slicing, while [daemon_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts) keeps the actual runtime-loop orchestration.

I added direct coverage in [daemon-command-state_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/daemon-command-state_test.ts) for the extracted policy, then removed the redundant seed-boundary and cursor-anchor recovery cases from [daemon-runtime_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts). I also updated the progress notes in [task.2026.2026-03-06-testing-review.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-03-06-testing-review.md) and [dev.testing.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/dev.testing.md).

Verification: `deno lint` on the touched files passed, the focused run for `tests/daemon-command-state_test.ts` and `tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts` passed (`55` tests), and `deno task test --frozen` passed repo-wide with `494` tests. The untracked conversation capture note remains in the worktree untouched.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2321_25

Extracted the next `daemon_runtime` refactor seam into [runtime_command_state.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/runtime_command_state.ts). That module now owns command-cursor anchor resolution, boundary segmentation, boundary snapshot slicing, and seed-event slicing, while [daemon_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts) keeps the actual runtime-loop orchestration.

I added direct coverage in [daemon-command-state_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/daemon-command-state_test.ts) for the extracted policy, then removed the redundant seed-boundary and cursor-anchor recovery cases from [daemon-runtime_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts). I also updated the progress notes in [task.2026.2026-03-06-testing-review.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-03-06-testing-review.md) and [dev.testing.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/dev.testing.md).

Verification: `deno lint` on the touched files passed, the focused run for `tests/daemon-command-state_test.ts` and `tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts` passed (`55` tests), and `deno task test --frozen` passed repo-wide with `494` tests. The untracked conversation capture note remains in the worktree untouched.

# djradon_2026-03-06_2321_49

proceed

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2321_59

I’m continuing from the verified command-state extraction. First I’m checking the remaining open seams in `provider_ingestion.ts` and `daemon_runtime.ts` so the next slice stays aligned with the task note rather than drifting into unrelated cleanup.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2322_02

The next realistic seam is in `provider_ingestion.ts`, not more `daemon_runtime` churn. I’m reading the cursor/anchor helper block and the current ingestion tests together so I can pull out a pure policy unit, add direct tests, and then delete the matching broad cases from `provider-ingestion_test.ts`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2322_17

I’m narrowing it to the resume-policy block inside `processSessionFile`: source-path resets, byte-offset truncation reset, Codex compaction backtrack, and Gemini anchor realignment/replay. That’s the part with real behavior still buried in the runner, and it lines up with the existing broad tests already in `provider-ingestion_test.ts`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2323_22

I’ve got the extraction boundary. I’m moving the resume/anchor policy into its own helper module now, then I’ll cut the broad provider-ingestion cases that only exist to prove that policy.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2325_49

I’m at the test split point now. The new direct file will own the resume-policy cases, and the broad ingestion suite will keep the runner/twin/dedupe behaviors that still need end-to-end coverage.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2327_06

The provider-ingestion extraction is in. I’m running lint and the focused provider suites now; the likely failure mode here is just type/import drift from moving the resume helpers out of the runner.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2327_10

Lint found exactly what I expected: stale imports left in `provider_ingestion.ts`. I’m stripping those now, then I’ll rerun lint and the same focused provider tests.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2328_05

The focused provider runs are clean. I’m doing the repo-wide `deno task test --frozen` pass now so this lands as another verified extraction, not just a local provider-only cleanup.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2328_13

The full suite is through type-check again. I’m just waiting on execution now; if it stays green, I’ll close this slice with the exact files changed and the new test count.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2328_37

The resume-policy extraction is verified. I’m doing one final worktree check so the close-out is precise about what changed and which files are still untracked from the active refactor pass.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2328_46

Continued with the next source/test extraction in `provider_ingestion`. Resume and anchor policy now lives in [provider_ingestion_resume.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion_resume.ts), and [provider_ingestion.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts) now calls that helper instead of carrying the cursor-reset, truncation, Codex compaction, and Gemini anchor realignment logic inline.

I added direct coverage in [provider-ingestion-resume_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/provider-ingestion-resume_test.ts) and removed the matching broad cases from [provider-ingestion_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/provider-ingestion_test.ts). The progress notes are updated in [task.2026.2026-03-06-testing-review.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-03-06-testing-review.md) and [dev.testing.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/dev.testing.md).

Verification is clean: focused lint passed, the focused provider run passed with `26` tests, and `deno task test --frozen` passed repo-wide with `498` tests. The worktree still includes the earlier runtime-command-state slice in [runtime_command_state.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/runtime_command_state.ts) plus the untracked conversation note, untouched by me.

# djradon_2026-03-06_2334_00

proceed

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2334_12

I’m continuing from the verified provider resume extraction. Next I’m scanning the remaining pure policy inside `provider_ingestion.ts` and `daemon_runtime.ts` so the next slice stays on the same refactor-for-testability track instead of turning into generic cleanup.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2334_18

The biggest remaining pure block is `mergeEvents` in `provider_ingestion.ts`. That’s the dedupe/fingerprint policy still covered mostly through broad runner tests, so I’m reading that next as the likely highest-ROI extraction.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2334_26

I’ve got a clean next seam: event-signature and merge/dedupe policy. That should let me pull three broad `provider-ingestion_test.ts` cases into a tiny direct test file without touching the runner lifecycle behavior.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2334_42

I’m editing the provider-ingestion merge/dedupe slice now: extract the pure merge/signature logic, add direct tests including the compaction-style ignore-timestamp/cursor path, then delete the three broad ingestion cases that only exist to prove dedupe semantics.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2335_46

The broad patch hit note formatting context, so I’m splitting it into smaller edits. I’m checking the current snippets first, then I’ll apply the merge extraction in smaller patches to avoid trampling the ongoing note changes.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2336_12

I’ve got the exact local block now. I’m applying the extraction in small patches: new merge module and test file first, then the source import swap, then the broad test deletions, then the note updates.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2337_05

The merge extraction is in. I’m formatting the touched files now, then I’ll run focused lint and provider tests before I widen to the full repo suite.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2337_15

Lint is clean. The focused provider run is still in flight; I’m polling that now, and if it stays green I’ll finish with the repo-wide `deno task test --frozen` pass again.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2337_18

The focused provider slice is clean. I’m running the full frozen suite now so this lands as another verified extraction rather than a partial local change.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2337_19

The full run is through type-check again. I’m waiting on execution; if it stays green, I’ll close this slice with the updated test count and the current worktree state.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2337_37

The merge slice is landed and verified. I’m taking one quick look at the remaining low-risk seam before I stop: `daemon_runtime` still has local memory-reporting policy that should be directly testable and could take a couple more broad runtime assertions off the board.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2337_50

There’s one more safe runtime seam and it’s smaller than another provider pass: memory telemetry. I’m extracting the pure sample/eviction logging helper now, then I’ll replace the broad “logs memory samples and evictions” runtime-loop test with a direct helper test and keep the status-snapshot integration test intact.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2338_53

The runtime patch hit the note context again, so I’m checking what actually landed before I proceed. If the code files didn’t move, I’ll reapply the runtime extraction in smaller pieces the same way.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2338_59

I’ve confirmed the runtime-memory files didn’t land yet, so I’m reapplying that slice in smaller patches. I’m doing code files first and leaving the note updates for last so there’s less surface area for patch drift.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2340_03

The runtime memory extraction is in now. I’m formatting the touched runtime files, then I’ll run focused lint and the new direct runtime-memory tests before I go back to the full suite.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2340_15

Lint found one trivial leftover import in `daemon_runtime.ts`. I’m removing that now; the focused runtime tests are still running in parallel, and then I’ll rerun lint on the final import set.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2340_28

The runtime extraction surfaced two type wiring issues: the memory types live in `shared`/`ingestion_runtime`, not `@kato/shared` alone, and `Object.entries` needs an explicit numeric tuple narrowing here. I’m fixing those now and rerunning the same focused checks.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2340_45

Lint is clean now. The focused runtime run is in flight; I’m polling it, and if it stays green I’ll do one final repo-wide `deno task test --frozen` pass on the expanded state.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2340_48

The focused runtime slice is clean as well. I’m running the full frozen suite one last time on the combined provider/runtime refactor state, then I’ll close out with the exact worktree and test count.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2340_57

The repo-wide pass is through type-check again. I’m just waiting on execution now; if it stays green, I’ll finish with the consolidated status for all slices landed in this turn.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2341_35

I’m finishing the in-flight runtime-memory extraction first, then I’ll inspect the remaining orchestrator code for the next clean test seam. After that I’ll run the focused checks and a repo test pass before deciding whether to land one more slice.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2341_42

The runtime-memory slice is wired up cleanly so far. I’m waiting on the full repo run and, in parallel, checking the remaining orchestrator helpers to see whether there’s another extraction that’s small enough to land cleanly in this pass.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2341_53

The full repo run is green with `501` passing tests, so the runtime-memory slice is safe to keep. I’m checking the task notes and the remaining large helpers now to choose the next extraction that actually reduces broad test pressure instead of just moving code around.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2341_54

The obvious next seam is the runtime filename/rendering policy. `daemon_runtime.ts` still owns the snippet slug, timestamp-token, and workspace filename logic, and the broad runtime harness is still carrying end-to-end filename-template assertions just to cover that policy.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2341_58

I’m pulling the exact runtime tests that still cover filename policy end to end. If they’re isolated enough, I can move that logic into a small helper module and cut two more high-cost runtime harness cases without affecting behavior.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2342_06

I’ve confirmed the repo test gate is green. The next slice looks viable: extract the filename/template token logic, add direct tests around DST and snippet fallback, and remove the two runtime-loop cases that only exist to validate rendered filenames.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2342_39

I’ve got the next edit scoped. I’m extracting the workspace filename/default-dir template logic into its own runtime helper, then I’ll add direct tests for DST token rendering and the `conversation` snippet fallback before trimming the two runtime-loop cases.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2345_09

The extraction is in place. I’m formatting and running lint on the touched runtime/template files next, then I’ll run the focused daemon tests and a final repo pass to make sure the new helper didn’t leave any call-site drift behind.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2345_17

Lint is clean. The focused daemon run is in flight now; once that passes I’ll do the repo-wide test gate one more time and then stop.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2345_22

The focused daemon coverage is green: `49` tests passed in the extracted template area plus the remaining runtime harness. I’m running the full repo gate now to lock the slice before I stop.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2345_35

The repo gate is green with `502` passing tests. I’m doing a final worktree check now so the close-out only mentions the files and counts that actually landed.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2345_58

Extracted the runtime workspace filename/default-output-dir template policy into [runtime_workspace_paths.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/runtime_workspace_paths.ts#L1). [daemon_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts#L57) now delegates filename rendering and default output-dir resolution there instead of carrying the token/rendering helpers inline.

I added direct coverage in [daemon-workspace-paths_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/daemon-workspace-paths_test.ts#L1) for DST-aware timestamp tokens, `conversation` slug fallback, and relative/absolute output-dir templates, then removed the two filename-template-only runtime harness cases from [daemon-runtime_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts). The notes are updated in [task.2026.2026-03-06-testing-review.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-03-06-testing-review.md#L210) and [dev.testing.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/dev.testing.md#L53).

The current stack in the worktree also still includes the earlier unreported slices in [runtime_memory_telemetry.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/runtime_memory_telemetry.ts), [provider_ingestion_merge.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion_merge.ts), [runtime_command_state.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/runtime_command_state.ts), and [provider_ingestion_resume.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion_resume.ts), with their corresponding direct tests.

Verification is clean: focused lint passed, the focused daemon workspace/runtime run passed with `49` tests, and `deno task test --frozen` passed repo-wide with `502` tests. The untracked conversation capture note [conv.2026.2026-03-06_2315-test-refactor-continues-codex.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-03-06_2315-test-refactor-continues-codex.md) remains untouched.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2347_30

I’m looking at the next seam in `daemon_runtime`: workspace-output state and cycle transitions. That logic is still local, mostly pure, and the runtime harness is still carrying several tests just to validate metadata mutations that can be covered directly.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2347_59

I’ve narrowed it to a pure metadata slice: workspace-output lookup, cycle open/close, stop-all, and destination-binding/retarget rules. I’m extracting that into its own helper and then moving the narrow cycle-state assertions out of the runtime-loop harness.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2348_49

I’m editing the workspace-output state slice now. The changes are confined to a new helper module, the runtime imports, a direct test file, and trimming the redundant runtime-loop cases that only assert metadata transitions.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2350_55

I hit a small note-edit mismatch after formatting changed the wrapped lines. I’m reopening the exact text and then updating the docs with the new workspace-output-state slice before running checks.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2351_08

The new helper and direct tests are in; I’m formatting the touched files now and then I’ll lint the runtime/helper/test set before running the focused daemon suite again.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2351_18

Lint is clean. The focused daemon run is executing now; once it’s green I’ll rerun the repo gate and stop at that point.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2351_23

The focused run surfaced only a typing issue in the new test: the shared destination contract makes the relative path optional even when `kind` is `workspace-relative`. I’m tightening those two assertions and rerunning the focused suite immediately.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2351_37

The focused daemon slice is green with `48` passing tests. I’m running the full repo gate now; if that passes, this extraction is done.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2351_50

The repo gate is green with `504` passing tests. I’m doing one last worktree and line-reference check so the close-out stays exact.

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2352_05

Extracted the next `daemon_runtime` seam into [runtime_workspace_output_state.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/runtime_workspace_output_state.ts#L1). That module now owns workspace-output lookup, cycle open/close, stop-all, profile snapshot refresh, and destination-binding/retarget rules, while [daemon_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts#L57) just calls the helper.

I added direct coverage in [daemon-workspace-output-state_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/daemon-workspace-output-state_test.ts#L1) and removed the redundant active-cycle, missing-pointer stop, and stop-then-resume binding cases from [daemon-runtime_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts). The notes are updated in [task.2026.2026-03-06-testing-review.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-03-06-testing-review.md#L217) and [dev.testing.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/dev.testing.md#L54).

Verification is clean: focused lint passed, the focused workspace-output/runtime run passed with `48` tests, and `deno task test --frozen` passed repo-wide with `504` tests. The earlier refactor slices and the untracked conversation note remain in the worktree untouched.

ok, let's pause at a commit seam

# gpt-5.4_2026-03-06_2352_19

This is a clean commit seam.

It groups one coherent refactor theme: moving policy-heavy runtime/provider helpers out of broad orchestration files, adding direct tests for each helper, and trimming overlapping harness coverage. The current seam includes:
- `runtime_command_state`
- `provider_ingestion_resume`
- `provider_ingestion_merge`
- `runtime_memory_telemetry`
- `runtime_workspace_paths`
- `runtime_workspace_output_state`

The paired broad-suite reductions are in `tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts` and `tests/provider-ingestion_test.ts`, with note updates in `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-03-06-testing-review.md` and `dev-docs/notes/dev.testing.md`.

Verification is already clean: focused suites passed, and `deno task test --frozen` passed repo-wide with `504` tests.

Suggested commit message:
`refactor: extract daemon runtime and provider test seams`

Continue the test-refactor work in `/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato`.

Current state:
- There is an uncommitted but clean commit seam ready.
- Suggested commit message: `refactor: extract daemon runtime and provider test seams`
- Do not revert unrelated user changes.
- Do not touch `dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-03-06_2315-test-refactor-continues-codex.md`.

Already extracted in the current worktree:

Broad-suite reductions already made:
- `tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts`

Notes already updated:
- `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-03-06-testing-review.md`
- `dev-docs/notes/dev.testing.md`

Verification status:
- Focused lint/test runs passed during the refactor.
- `deno task test --frozen` passed repo-wide with `504` tests.

Working style constraints:
- Use `apply_patch` for edits.
- Prefer `rg` for search.
- Keep proceeding without asking unless blocked.
- Preserve the current established refactor direction: extract pure/policy-heavy helpers from broad orchestrator files, add direct tests, then remove redundant broad harness cases.

Suggested first step:
- Run `git status --short`.
- Inspect the remaining large seams in `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts` and `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts`.
- Continue only if there is another small, coherent extraction worth landing after this seam; otherwise stop and confirm this seam is commit-ready.
