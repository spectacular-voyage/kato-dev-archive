Per-workspace daemon instances

I figured out a solution for workspace-specific kato usage: just "kato init" in the workspace, and you can specify the default path, filename template, and ConversationEventKind capture settings in the workspace-specific config.

I don't even think we need to change much, just add the defaultOutputPath and filename template.

::capture /home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-27-per-workspace-daemons

**Planning code inspection**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_2009_20

I’m treating this as a code change: wire workspace-local `kato init` config to support `defaultOutputPath` and a filename template, with minimal surface area. I’ll inspect the config schema, `kato init`, and the capture/output path logic first so the change lands in the right layer.

**Targeting key config files**

The relevant pieces are in the daemon config layer and `init`. I’m narrowing to the config contract, runtime loader, and init scaffolding so we can add the two new fields without disturbing command handling.

# User_2026-02-27_2013_56

Sorry, help me plan and fill out [task.2026.2026-02-27-per-workspace-daemons.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-27-per-workspace-daemons.md)

**Planning task note inspection**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_2014_08

I’ll open the task note and the related conversation note, then I’ll turn that into a concrete implementation plan and draft the note content directly in the file.

**Inspecting task note patterns**

The task note is just frontmatter right now. I’m checking a couple of existing task notes so the new one matches the repo’s format and level of detail.

**Planning task note content**

I have the note format now. I’m checking the exact code paths for generated output destinations so the task note points at the right modules and keeps the proposed change minimal, as you described.

**Locating default path generator**

**Examining export command for output path**

**Clarifying per-workspace daemon config**

**Clarifying workspace runtime config handling**

I’m grounding the plan in the existing config and test surface so the note can point to the minimal code changes: schema, defaults, and the few places that generate output paths.

**Considering updating note timestamp**

I have enough context to draft the note. I’m grabbing a current timestamp so the note frontmatter stays consistent with the rest of your docs, then I’ll patch the task file with a focused plan.

**Clarifying per-workspace daemon config**
**Assessing default output path handling**

**Clarifying default path handling and config structure**
**Defining default output path semantics**
**Defining workspace-local config defaults**
**Drafting structured patch content**
**Designing default output config**
**Planning config path handling**

I’m patching the task note now. The draft will lock the simpler direction: one daemon instance per workspace, no registry/merge work, and only the config additions needed for generated output destinations.

**Planning quick file verification**

The task note is drafted. I’m doing one quick readback pass to make sure the frontmatter and sections landed cleanly and the scope stays aligned with your minimal approach.

**Finalizing implementation note**

I filled out [task.2026.2026-02-27-per-workspace-daemons.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-27-per-workspace-daemons.md) as a focused planning note.

It now locks the simpler direction you described: per-workspace daemon instances as independent configs, no workspace registry/merge layer, and only two new runtime-config fields for generated destinations: `defaultOutputPath` and `defaultFilenameTemplate`. I also added a concrete implementation plan, test plan, acceptance criteria, and an explicit rule that relative default paths resolve against the config location (`katoDir`), not daemon cwd.

I kept one naming question open in the note (`defaultFilenameTemplate` vs `filenameTemplate`) and called out that `ConversationEventKind` capture already fits the existing config model, so this task does not invent a second mechanism there.

No tests were run since this was a doc-only edit.

1. If you want, I can tighten the note further around exact field names and defaults.
2. If you want to move straight to code, I can implement the config fields next.

# User_2026-02-27_2130_35

filenameTemplate is fine.

Your task write-up has a few issues:
- the summary introduces contex that isn't relevant, since the "global config + workspace registry + merge" hasn't been implemented. It just confuses the situation
- Similarly with recommendation, we don't need to say what we won't do or mention the 
- we will support relative command arguments
- Non-Goals is repetitive of other stuff I think we can remove.

I'd like to add support for a configTeamplate that can be stored in ~/.kato/ : if present it will be used when initializing new per-workspace setups. So people can re-use the preferred filenameTempalte, MessageKinds, providers, etc.

Filename templating should support "sluggified snippet" and you should be able to specify timestamp-related stuff as YYYY or MM down to seconds, and use local values, not UTC-0.

**Planning comprehensive note updates**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_2130_49

I’m revising the task note around your corrections: remove misleading future-architecture framing, make relative path arguments part of the plan, add the `configTemplate` bootstrap concept, and expand filename templating to cover slugified snippets plus local-time date parts.

**Adding timestamp update to patch**

**Planning configTemplate support**
**Refining config path and token conventions**
**Refining config initialization approach**
**Refining workspace template handling**

I’m rewriting the body rather than trying to tweak individual bullets. That keeps the note coherent around the new contract: runtime defaults, relative path support, and template-driven `kato init`.

**Confirming nested bullets allowance**
**Supporting workspace-local configs**

I’ve applied the substantive changes. I’m doing one readback pass to make sure the note now reflects your intended scope and doesn’t carry the earlier distracting framing.

**Noting unresolved template filename**

I updated [task.2026.2026-02-27-per-workspace-daemons.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-27-per-workspace-daemons.md) to match your corrections.

The note now:
- drops the misleading comparison to unimplemented workspace-registry/merge ideas
- removes the old “what we won’t do” framing and deletes the repetitive Non-Goals section
- switches the config key to `filenameTemplate`
- changes the plan to support relative explicit command arguments, resolved against the workspace/config root
- adds a global `configTemplate` concept in `~/.kato/` for seeding new workspace configs during `kato init`
- expands filename templating to include `snippetSlug` plus local-time `{YYYY}`, `{MM}`, `{DD}`, `{HH}`, `{mm}`, `{ss}` tokens

I left one open question in the doc about the exact template filename under `~/.kato/`, since you described the behavior but not the exact path. No tests were run since this was a doc edit.

1. If you want, I can tighten that remaining open question and lock a specific template filename/path.
2. If you want to move from planning to implementation, I can start with the config contract and runtime loader changes next.

# User_2026-02-27_2150_00

template filename can be kato-config.template.yaml

Yes, if no argument is provided for export, the same filename generator and defaultOutputPath should be used.

One more feature idea: if the output argument is just a directory path, use that instead of defaultOutputPath, but still use the filename generator.

**Preparing concise note patch**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_2150_05

I’m folding those decisions into the task note now: lock the template filename, apply the same generated-path behavior to pathless `export`, and add the “directory argument means generate filename in that directory” rule.

I’m patching the existing sections directly so the note stays internally consistent rather than appending extra bullets.

**Checking list numbering consistency**

I’m checking the note once to catch any awkward wording or numbering drift from the patch.

**Clarifying directory output behavior**
**Refining export command behavior**

There’s one small cleanup: the goal list has a duplicated `4`, and I’m also tightening the directory-argument rule so it explicitly covers CLI `kato export --output <dir>` rather than leaving that as an open question.

I’ve cleaned that up. I’m doing a quick readback of the edited sections to confirm the list and the CLI export rule are now aligned.

**Noting timestamp update nuance**

I updated [task.2026.2026-02-27-per-workspace-daemons.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-27-per-workspace-daemons.md) with those decisions.

It now explicitly locks:
- the template path as `~/.kato/kato-config.template.yaml`
- pathless `export` using the same `filenameTemplate` + `defaultOutputPath` generator
- directory-path arguments as “override the base directory, still generate the filename”
- the same directory rule for CLI `kato export <id> --output <dir>`

I also removed the now-obsolete open question about CLI export directory behavior and cleaned up the numbering in the goal list.

No tests were run since this was a doc-only edit.

1. If you want, I can make one more pass on the note to lock the non-existent-directory rule (for example: existing dir only vs trailing slash also counts as dir).
2. If you want to start implementation, the next sensible step is updating the config contract and runtime config loader.

# User_2026-02-27_2203_46

#1 yes.

I will start a new conversation for implementation.

**Locking directory-path rule in docs**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_2203_57

I’m locking the directory-path rule in the task note so implementation has a deterministic contract: existing directory always counts, and a non-existent path counts as a directory only when the user explicitly signals it with a trailing separator.

I’m patching the note now in the path rules, tests, and risk section so the implementation conversation can treat that behavior as settled.

**Verifying nested bullet formatting**

I’m checking the edited section once so the rule reads cleanly and doesn’t conflict with the rest of the task note.

**Summarizing update readiness**

I updated [task.2026.2026-02-27-per-workspace-daemons.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-27-per-workspace-daemons.md) to lock the directory-detection rule.

The note now treats directory arguments as:
- existing directory: always a directory
- non-existent path ending with a path separator: directory
- otherwise: file path

I also reflected that in the tests, acceptance criteria, and risk/mitigation text so the implementation thread can treat it as settled.

No tests were run since this was a doc-only edit.
