Are we ready to test?

Are we ready to test? 

::capture /home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-23-testing.md

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_0949_21

Yes, we’re ready to test locally.

I ran `deno task ci` on **2026-02-23** and all gates passed:
- `fmt:check` pass
- `lint` pass
- `check --frozen` pass
- `test --frozen` pass (`98 passed`, `0 failed`)

I also captured this in `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-23-testing.md:1`.

Remaining non-code blockers are process/platform items: branch protection enforcement, CI coverage/patch gate, and release workflow/environment setup.

# User_2026-02-23_0949_21

::capture [conv.2026.2026-02-23-testing.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-23-testing.md)

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_0949_21

I’ll open that conversation note and capture this testing exchange into it in the same style used by your other `conv.*` notes.

# User_2026-02-23_0949_21

Sorry, you're supposed to ignore lines that start with ::capture (or other commands)

Anyhow, kato is not starting a recording. judgin from the status, it isn't picking up the command:

daemon: running (pid: 241621)
schemaVersion: 1
generatedAt: 2026-02-23T07:54:55.145Z
heartbeatAt: 2026-02-23T07:54:55.145Z
providers: 2
recordings: 0 active (0 destinations)

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_0949_21

You’re right. Root cause was real: `::record`/`::capture` detection existed but was never wired into the runtime ingestion path, so recordings never started from chat commands.

I fixed it in code:

- Wired in-chat command processing into the daemon loop so newly ingested user messages are evaluated and applied: `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:341`, `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:607`
- Added command execution handling for `record`, `capture`, `export`, `stop` with fail-closed behavior on parse errors: `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:179`
- Added command-path normalization so IDE-style inputs work (e.g. `@path` and markdown link paths): `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:153`
- Appends newly ingested messages to active recordings after command handling: `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:416`

Regression tests added:

- `runDaemonRuntimeLoop applies in-chat ::record commands from newly ingested messages`: `tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts:1221`
- `runDaemonRuntimeLoop fails closed when in-chat command parsing reports errors`: `tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts:1440`

Validation:

- Ran full gate: `deno task ci`
- Result: pass (`100 passed`, `0 failed`)

Next step: restart the daemon process (it’s currently running old code), then send a fresh `::record ...` command in a new message and re-check `kato status`.

# User_2026-02-23_0949_21

on the CLI side, "kato stop" doesn't appear to stop the daemon.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_0949_21

Confirmed. The issue was not CLI enqueue; it was daemon shutdown hanging.

**Root Cause**
- `kato stop` requests were reaching the daemon (`daemon.control.received` was logged), but the daemon could hang on shutdown while waiting for the filesystem watcher task.
- In `watchFsDebounced`, abort was only checked inside the watch loop, so if no FS event arrived, the loop never exited.

**Fix Applied**
- Patched watcher abort handling in `apps/daemon/src/core/watcher.ts:69`:
  - attach `AbortSignal` listener that closes `Deno.watchFs`
  - safely handle double-close/`BadResource`
  - clean listener and propagate close errors safely
- Added regression test in `tests/daemon-watcher_test.ts:55`:
  - verifies watcher exits promptly on abort even with zero FS events

**Validation**
- `deno task ci` passes (`101 passed`, `0 failed`).

No `stop` CLI logic changes were needed.

1. Restart daemon with updated code, then run `kato stop` again.
2. If you’re using a compiled `kato` binary, rebuild/reinstall it so this watcher fix is included.
3. Verify with `kato status` immediately and again after 1-2s.

# User_2026-02-23_0949_21

::capture [conv.2026.2026-02-23-testing.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-23-testing.md)

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_0949_21

Ignoring that line as a Kato control command (`::capture`), per your rule.

# User_2026-02-23_0949_21

ok, restarted the daemon. recordings is 0 active, 0 destinations. even though I just issued the capture command in thie chat.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_0949_21

Two separate things are happening.

- `recordings` in `status` only tracks active `::record` streams, not one-shot `::capture` writes (`apps/daemon/src/writer/recording_pipeline.ts:212`, `apps/daemon/src/writer/recording_pipeline.ts:323`).
- Your `::capture` was logged at **2026-02-23T08:13:48Z**, but the daemon you restarted started at **2026-02-23T08:14:08Z**. Current runtime intentionally does not replay pre-start messages on first ingest (`apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:369`).

Also, your config currently denies writing to this repo path:

- `~/.kato/config.json:6` has `"allowedWriteRoots": ["~/hub/djradon/stenobot"]`
- So captures to `~/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/...` are outside policy (I verified via `kato export ... --output ...` and it was denied).

Use this sequence:

1. Add `~/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato` to `allowedWriteRoots` in `~/.kato/config.json`.
2. Restart daemon.
3. If you want `recordings > 0`, send `::record <path>`.
4. If you send `::capture <path>`, expect file output but `recordings` can still stay `0`.

If you want, I can patch command processing to optionally replay the most recent command after daemon restart.

# User_2026-02-23_0949_21

capture should also start recording after writing the existing part of the conversation.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_0949_21

Implemented.

`::capture <path>` now:

1. writes a snapshot of the conversation so far, then  
2. starts/rotates active recording to that same path for ongoing appends.

Changes:
- `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:270`
- `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:278`

Added regression test:
- `tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts:1440` (`runDaemonRuntimeLoop applies in-chat ::capture then activates recording on same path`)

Validation:
- `deno task ci` passed (`102 passed`, `0 failed`).

After pulling these changes into your running daemon process, `::capture ...` should leave you with an active recording stream on that destination.

# User_2026-02-23_0949_21

what is formatter

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_0949_21

A formatter is a tool that automatically rewrites code to a consistent style (indentation, spacing, line breaks, quote style), without changing behavior.

In this repo, the formatter is Deno’s:

- Format files: `deno fmt`
- Check formatting only: `deno fmt --check` (or `deno task fmt:check`)

# User_2026-02-23_0949_21

lets also add a "kato restart" command that stops and starts the daemon. If it's not running already, "kato restart" should just start the daemon

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_0949_21

Implemented `kato restart` with the behavior you requested.

- If daemon is running and not stale: `restart` queues `stop`, waits for daemon to report stopped, then starts it.
- If daemon is not running (or status is stale): `restart` just starts it.

Key changes:
- New command implementation: `apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/restart.ts:39`
- Wired into CLI command exports: `apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/mod.ts:4`
- Added command type: `apps/daemon/src/cli/types.ts:6`
- Added parser + help topic support: `apps/daemon/src/cli/parser.ts:80`
- Added usage/help text: `apps/daemon/src/cli/usage.ts:9`
- Routed in command dispatcher and auto-init path: `apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts:266`
- README command reference updated: `README.md:47`

Tests added/updated:
- `tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:301` parser accepts `restart`
- `tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:378` restart auto-inits when config missing
- `tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:626` restart starts when not running
- `tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:650` restart stop-then-start when running

Validation:
- `deno task ci` passes (`106 passed`, `0 failed`).

You can now run:
- `deno run -A apps/daemon/src/main.ts restart`

# User_2026-02-23_0949_21

let's add a "--version" flag that prints the current version. Version should be controlled (I think) in deno.json, so we might have to import that... but right now deno.json is at the top level, and we should allow independent versioning. Probably the "cloud" app will be in a separate repo, but still the cli and web version should be allowed to vary independently.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_0949_21

Implemented.

- Added global `--version` and `-V` parsing and intent handling in `apps/daemon/src/cli/parser.ts:217` and `apps/daemon/src/cli/types.ts:27`.
- Added router short-circuit to print version without loading runtime config in `apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts:180`.
- Version source is now app-local via JSON import in `apps/daemon/src/version.ts:1`, with value from `apps/daemon/deno.json:2`.
- Added independent web app version source in `apps/web/src/version.ts:1`, backed by `apps/web/deno.json:2`, and exported from `apps/web/src/mod.ts:3`.
- Exported daemon version constant from `apps/daemon/src/mod.ts:7`.
- Updated usage/docs in `apps/daemon/src/cli/usage.ts:4` and `README.md:40`.
- Added tests for `--version` / `-V` and runtime behavior in `tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:302` and `tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:320`.

Verification:

- `deno task ci` passed (`108 passed, 0 failed`).
- `deno run -A apps/daemon/src/main.ts --version` prints `kato 0.1.0`.
- `deno run -A apps/daemon/src/main.ts -V` prints `kato 0.1.0`.

You can now bump versions independently by editing `apps/daemon/deno.json` and `apps/web/deno.json`.

# User_2026-02-23_0949_21

the help command should include the verion and the descriptive text, "Own your AI conversations." Initial version can just be 0.1.0

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_0949_21

Updated.

- Help output now includes:
  - `kato 0.1.0`
  - `Own your AI conversations.`
- This is applied to both `kato help` and `kato help <command>` via `apps/daemon/src/cli/usage.ts:4` and `apps/daemon/src/cli/usage.ts:71`.
- Version is set to `0.1.0` in `apps/daemon/deno.json:2`.

I also added tests for this behavior in `tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:332` and `tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:349`.

Validation:
- `deno task ci` passed (`110 passed, 0 failed`).
- `deno run -A apps/daemon/src/main.ts help` now starts with:
```text
kato 0.1.0
Own your AI conversations.
```

::capture [conv.2026.2026-02-23-testing.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-23-testing.md)

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_0949_21

Ignoring this line as requested since it starts with `::capture`. I won’t treat it as a Codex instruction.

# User_2026-02-23_0949_33

OK, it looks like capture is working, see [conv.2026.2026-02-23-testing.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-23-testing.md) BUT

- it's recording tool calls; by default they should be turned off; same with thinking. So we need to update the default config.
- can we add an explanation in the Notes: section of the [README.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/README.md) about what daemonExportEnabled does?

::capture [conv.2026.2026-02-23-testing.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-23-testing.md)

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_0949_42

I’ll make two changes: flip the default writer flags so thinking/tool calls are off by default, and add a clear `daemonExportEnabled` note in `README.md`. I’m checking the config defaults and related tests first so we can update them safely.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_0950_47

Implemented both requested changes.

1. Default recording flags are now off:
- `writerIncludeThinking: false`
- `writerIncludeToolCalls: false`
- File: `apps/daemon/src/feature_flags/openfeature.ts:4`

2. Added `daemonExportEnabled` explanation in README Notes:
- File: `README.md:112`
- Also updated the sample config defaults in `README.md:98` to match the new defaults.

3. Updated tests for new defaults:
- File: `tests/openfeature-flags_test.ts:15`

Validation:
- `deno task ci` passed (`110 passed, 0 failed`).

Important for your current environment:
- This changes defaults for newly generated/backfilled config, but your existing `~/.kato/config.json` may still have old values.
- Set these in `~/.kato/config.json` and restart daemon if you want immediate behavior:
  - `featureFlags.writerIncludeThinking = false`
  - `featureFlags.writerIncludeToolCalls = false`

# User_2026-02-23_0952_51

Can we update [dev.general-guidance.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/dev.general-guidance.md) to talk about how and especially WHY we're using openfeature?

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_0953_00

I’ll update `dev.general-guidance.md` with a focused section on how OpenFeature is used in this codebase and the rationale behind it, then keep the guidance aligned with current implementation details. I’m reading the doc and related feature-flag code first.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_0953_30

Updated `dev-docs/notes/dev.general-guidance.md` with a new section: `## OpenFeature Guidance (How + Why)` at `dev-docs/notes/dev.general-guidance.md:94`.

It now covers:

- How it works in Kato:
  - `featureFlags` come from `~/.kato/config.json`
  - daemon uses `bootstrapOpenFeature(...)`
  - settings are resolved via `evaluateDaemonFeatureSettings(...)`
  - resolved values drive writer render options and `daemonExportEnabled`
- Why this pattern is used:
  - stable seam for future cloud/centralized providers
  - deterministic local/no-network behavior
  - explicit policy surface for sensitive/noisy output
  - fail-closed config behavior for unknown/malformed flags
- Implementation rules for adding flags:
  - update contract, defaults/evaluation, config parsing, and tests

I also ran `deno fmt` on that file.

# User_2026-02-23_0956_08

I don't think we need to log "Provider ingestion cursor updated" into security-audit.json. I would think we would log security-sensitive things only, like an attempt to read or write from a disallowed path or ??? -- what was the original purpose of security-audit.json ?

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_0956_21

I’ll trace where `security-audit.json` is written and specifically where “Provider ingestion cursor updated” is emitted, then summarize the original intent and whether that event belongs there.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_0957_27

Your intuition matches the original intent.

`security-audit.jsonl` was intended as a separate **audit trail for policy/control/security-relevant events**, not a duplicate of routine runtime telemetry.

Source-of-truth intent:
- `dev-docs/notes/dev.security-baseline.md:36` and `dev-docs/notes/dev.security-baseline.md:82` require auditable security-relevant allow/deny decisions.
- `dev-docs/notes/dev.security-baseline.md:95` says security audit logs must be separate from operational logs.
- `dev-docs/notes/dev.codebase-overview.md:215` describes audit as “control, policy, and security-relevant events.”
- `dev-docs/notes/dev.decision-log.md:48` set up separate operational vs security-audit sinks.

Current drift:
- We currently log `provider.ingestion.cursor_updated` to audit at `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:839`, which is operational progress, not security-sensitive.

So yes, “Provider ingestion cursor updated” is a good candidate to remove from `security-audit.jsonl` (keep it only in operational logs).  
If you want, I can patch that now and also trim similar ingestion-noise audit events in the same file.

# User_2026-02-23_1017_49

Yes, and also remove "Provider ingestion cursor updated" from operational.jsonl. 

The status command should include, at least, a list of currently recording sessions,  i.e., active sessions and their output destinations. Here's an example from stenobot:

  ● claude-code: "I'm considering a ground-up rewrite of Stenobot (henceforth ..."
    → /home/djradon/hub/djradon/stenobot/documentation/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-21-security-and-deno-claude.md
    Started 1 day ago · Last export 1 day ago

The session ID should be included after the provider

If you pass the --all flag to status, it should list stale sessions (and their recordings) as well.

Would love to hear your thoughts on this feature, e.g. what the best format is, best functionality, etc. The web app, let's call it kato-status-web, will use a lot of the same logic, so we should put it in shared. 

Please flesh out this task in [task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md)

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_1018_09

I’ll flesh out that task note with concrete scope, UX proposal, shared-model design, and implementation/testing steps, including your requested log changes (`cursor_updated` removal from both channels). I’m reading the current task file and relevant status/log contracts first.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_1020_54

Updated both the task note and the immediate log change.

## What I changed

1. Fleshed out the task doc with scope, UX, shared-model plan, implementation steps, tests, and acceptance criteria:
- `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md:9`
- Includes your requirements for:
  - removing `provider.ingestion.cursor_updated` from both logs
  - richer `kato status` session/recording list
  - `status --all` to include stale sessions/recordings
  - shared logic for daemon + `kato-status-web`

2. Removed `provider.ingestion.cursor_updated` logging emissions from ingestion runtime:
- `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:820`
- After cursor update, it now returns without writing that event to either channel.

## Validation

- `deno test --allow-read --allow-write=.kato tests/provider-ingestion_test.ts --frozen` passed.
- `deno task ci` passed (`110 passed, 0 failed`).

## My recommendations on format/functionality

- Keep `status --json` as the full, rich snapshot model; use `--all` primarily for text filtering behavior.
- In text mode, use a compact 3-line session block (provider/sessionId + snippet, destination, relative times), with `●` active and `○` stale.
- Prefer `last write` over `last export` unless we separately track one-off export timestamps (current pipeline natively tracks `lastWriteAt`).

If you want, I can implement the full status feature next following the task plan in that note.

# User_2026-02-23_1021_37

You offered to "also trim similar ingestion-noise audit events in the same file." Is there anything worth saving? Did you include the "access failure" events I discussed?

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_1021_49

Good callout. I’ll enumerate every ingestion audit event currently emitted, classify keep/drop, and confirm whether access-failure events were included in the plan text.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_1022_17

Short answer: not yet.

- I removed only `provider.ingestion.cursor_updated` from both logs.
- I did **not** add explicit access-failure audit events in code.
- In the task note, I only mentioned access denials conceptually (`dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md:48`), not as a concrete event contract.

Current ingestion access failures are still silent in several places:
- `Deno.stat` permission denied -> returns `false` with no log in `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:237`.
- `Deno.readDir` permission denied -> `continue` with no log in `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:263`.
- per-session `Deno.stat` permission denied -> skip session with no log in `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:724`.

What’s worth saving in audit:
- Keep: explicit access denials (read/write permission failures), policy allow/deny decisions.
- Probably keep: parse failures if you want tamper/corruption signal.
- Drop from audit as noise: started/stopped lifecycle and duplicate/drop counters.

If you want, I can implement a concrete `provider.ingestion.read_denied` audit event now and update the task doc acceptance criteria accordingly.

# User_2026-02-23_1045_36

Could you move the logging stuff into a separate task, [task.2026.2026-02-23-awesome-logging.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-23-awesome-logging.md) -- it should include setting the log level. And I think I want to use LogLayer

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_1045_54

I’ll split the concerns cleanly: remove logging work from the improved-status task, then flesh out `task.2026.2026-02-23-awesome-logging.md` with logging scope, log-level controls, and a LogLayer adoption path. I’m opening both task files now.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_1047_21

Done. I split the work exactly as requested.

- `task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md` is now status-only and points logging work to `[[task.2026.2026-02-23-awesome-logging]]`.
  - See `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md:11`
- `task.2026.2026-02-23-awesome-logging.md` now contains:
  - channel taxonomy and noise-reduction scope
  - access-failure audit events (`provider.ingestion.read_denied`)
  - runtime log-level configuration plan (config + env overrides)
  - LogLayer adoption/migration plan
  - implementation steps, tests, acceptance criteria
  - See `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-23-awesome-logging.md:9`

I also formatted both files with `deno fmt`.  
I did not run full CI since this was docs-only.

# User_2026-02-23_1053_41

Can you add that I'd like to use OpenTelemetry plugin with LogLayer, and support OpenTelemetry generally through the codebase.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_1053_49

I’ll update the logging task to explicitly require LogLayer’s OpenTelemetry plugin and add a cross-codebase OpenTelemetry support track (traces/metrics/log correlation), with concrete implementation and acceptance criteria.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-23_1054_33

Added.

`dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-23-awesome-logging.md` now explicitly includes:

- Using **LogLayer’s OpenTelemetry plugin** as part of the logging backend.
- Supporting OpenTelemetry **across the codebase** (not daemon-only), including reusable instrumentation helpers for `daemon`, `web`, and `cloud`.
- Correlating logs with trace context (`trace_id` / `span_id`).
- OTel configuration expectations (default disabled, optional exporter endpoint).
- Implementation, testing, and acceptance criteria for OTel integration.

I also formatted the file with `deno fmt`.

# User_2026-02-24_0910_34

how do i find a session-id to test export. does export take a destination parameter?

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-24_0910_52

I’ll check the CLI/export implementation and provider session parsing so I can give you exact commands to find valid `session-id` values and confirm destination flags.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-24_0911_45

Yes.

- `export` syntax is `kato export <session-id> [--output <path>]` (`-o` alias) in `apps/daemon/src/cli/parser.ts:139` and `apps/daemon/src/cli/usage.ts:60`.
- In practice right now, destination is effectively required: daemon skips export if `outputPath` is missing (`apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:821`).

Quick way to get a valid `session-id`:

1. Check provider roots in your config:
```bash
cat ~/.kato/config.json
```
Look at `providerSessionRoots.claude` and `providerSessionRoots.codex`.

2. Claude IDs (easy): ID is filename without `.jsonl` (`apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:303`)
```bash
rg --files ~/.claude/projects | rg '\.jsonl$' | head
# session-id = basename(file, ".jsonl")
```

3. Codex IDs: ID comes from `session_meta.payload.id` (`apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:396`)
```bash
rg -n '"type":"session_meta".*"id":"' ~/.codex/sessions -g '*.jsonl' | head
```
Use the `"id":"..."` value as `session-id`.

Then test:
```bash
kato export <session-id> --output ./exports/test.md
```

If you want, I can add a `kato sessions` command next so you don’t have to inspect raw provider files.

**Finalizing fix explanation and instructions**

</details>

You’re right. Root cause was real: `::record`/`::capture` detection existed but was never wired into the runtime ingestion path, so recordings never started from chat commands.

I fixed it in code:

- Wired in-chat command processing into the daemon loop so newly ingested user messages are evaluated and applied: `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:341`, `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:607`
- Added command execution handling for `record`, `capture`, `export`, `stop` with fail-closed behavior on parse errors: `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:179`
- Added command-path normalization so IDE-style inputs work (e.g. `@path` and markdown link paths): `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:153`
- Appends newly ingested messages to active recordings after command handling: `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:416`

Regression tests added:

- `runDaemonRuntimeLoop applies in-chat ::record commands from newly ingested messages`: `tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts:1221`
- `runDaemonRuntimeLoop fails closed when in-chat command parsing reports errors`: `tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts:1440`

Validation:

- Ran full gate: `deno task ci`
- Result: pass (`100 passed`, `0 failed`)

Next step: restart the daemon process (it’s currently running old code), then send a fresh `::record ...` command in a new message and re-check `kato status`.

**Summarizing watcher fix and next steps**

</details>

I confirmed and fixed the stop bug: shutdown was hanging inside watcher teardown, not in CLI enqueue. I’m grabbing exact file references and then I’ll give you a concise verification flow.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Summarizing fix, validation, next steps**

</details>

Confirmed. The issue was not CLI enqueue; it was daemon shutdown hanging.

**Root Cause**
- `kato stop` requests were reaching the daemon (`daemon.control.received` was logged), but the daemon could hang on shutdown while waiting for the filesystem watcher task.
- In `watchFsDebounced`, abort was only checked inside the watch loop, so if no FS event arrived, the loop never exited.

**Fix Applied**
- Patched watcher abort handling in `apps/daemon/src/core/watcher.ts:69`:
  - attach `AbortSignal` listener that closes `Deno.watchFs`
  - safely handle double-close/`BadResource`
  - clean listener and propagate close errors safely
- Added regression test in `tests/daemon-watcher_test.ts:55`:
  - verifies watcher exits promptly on abort even with zero FS events

**Validation**
- `deno task ci` passes (`101 passed`, `0 failed`).

No `stop` CLI logic changes were needed.

1. Restart daemon with updated code, then run `kato stop` again.
2. If you’re using a compiled `kato` binary, rebuild/reinstall it so this watcher fix is included.
3. Verify with `kato status` immediately and again after 1-2s.

**Summarizing capture failure and config fix**

</details>

Two separate things are happening.

- `recordings` in `status` only tracks active `::record` streams, not one-shot `::capture` writes (`apps/daemon/src/writer/recording_pipeline.ts:212`, `apps/daemon/src/writer/recording_pipeline.ts:323`).
- Your `::capture` was logged at **2026-02-23T08:13:48Z**, but the daemon you restarted started at **2026-02-23T08:14:08Z**. Current runtime intentionally does not replay pre-start messages on first ingest (`apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:369`).

Also, your config currently denies writing to this repo path:

- `~/.kato/config.json:6` has `"allowedWriteRoots": ["~/hub/djradon/stenobot"]`
- So captures to `~/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/...` are outside policy (I verified via `kato export ... --output ...` and it was denied).

Use this sequence:

1. Add `~/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato` to `allowedWriteRoots` in `~/.kato/config.json`.
2. Restart daemon.
3. If you want `recordings > 0`, send `::record <path>`.
4. If you send `::capture <path>`, expect file output but `recordings` can still stay `0`.

If you want, I can patch command processing to optionally replay the most recent command after daemon restart.

# User_unknown-time

capture should also start recording after writing the existing part of the conversation.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Planning combined capture and recording**

</details>

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

I understand: you want `::capture <path>` to do a snapshot write and then continue as an active recording stream to the same path. I’m implementing that behavior in runtime command handling and adding a regression test.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Implementing capture and startOrRotate behavior**

</details>

I’m changing `::capture` handling to perform snapshot write first and then activate recording on that same path, and I’ll add a runtime test that asserts that exact sequence.

I’ve implemented the behavior change and added a dedicated runtime test for `capture -> start recording`. I’m running formatter and CI now.

Implemented.

`::capture <path>` now:

1. writes a snapshot of the conversation so far, then  
2. starts/rotates active recording to that same path for ongoing appends.

Changes:
- `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:270`
- `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:278`

Added regression test:
- `tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts:1440` (`runDaemonRuntimeLoop applies in-chat ::capture then activates recording on same path`)

Validation:
- `deno task ci` passed (`102 passed`, `0 failed`).

After pulling these changes into your running daemon process, `::capture ...` should leave you with an active recording stream on that destination.

A formatter is a tool that automatically rewrites code to a consistent style (indentation, spacing, line breaks, quote style), without changing behavior.

In this repo, the formatter is Deno’s:

- Format files: `deno fmt`
- Check formatting only: `deno fmt --check` (or `deno task fmt:check`)

**Summarizing final outcome**

</details>

Implemented `kato restart` with the behavior you requested.

- If daemon is running and not stale: `restart` queues `stop`, waits for daemon to report stopped, then starts it.
- If daemon is not running (or status is stale): `restart` just starts it.

Key changes:
- New command implementation: `apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/restart.ts:39`
- Wired into CLI command exports: `apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/mod.ts:4`
- Added command type: `apps/daemon/src/cli/types.ts:6`
- Added parser + help topic support: `apps/daemon/src/cli/parser.ts:80`
- Added usage/help text: `apps/daemon/src/cli/usage.ts:9`
- Routed in command dispatcher and auto-init path: `apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts:266`
- README command reference updated: `README.md:47`

Tests added/updated:
- `tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:301` parser accepts `restart`
- `tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:378` restart auto-inits when config missing
- `tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:626` restart starts when not running
- `tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:650` restart stop-then-start when running

Validation:
- `deno task ci` passes (`106 passed`, `0 failed`).

You can now run:
- `deno run -A apps/daemon/src/main.ts restart`

# User_unknown-time

let's add a "--version" flag that prints the current version. Version should be controlled (I think) in deno.json, so we might have to import that... but right now deno.json is at the top level, and we should allow independent versioning. Probably the "cloud" app will be in a separate repo, but still the cli and web version should be allowed to vary independently.

Implemented.

- Added global `--version` and `-V` parsing and intent handling in `apps/daemon/src/cli/parser.ts:217` and `apps/daemon/src/cli/types.ts:27`.
- Added router short-circuit to print version without loading runtime config in `apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts:180`.
- Version source is now app-local via JSON import in `apps/daemon/src/version.ts:1`, with value from `apps/daemon/deno.json:2`.
- Added independent web app version source in `apps/web/src/version.ts:1`, backed by `apps/web/deno.json:2`, and exported from `apps/web/src/mod.ts:3`.
- Exported daemon version constant from `apps/daemon/src/mod.ts:7`.
- Updated usage/docs in `apps/daemon/src/cli/usage.ts:4` and `README.md:40`.
- Added tests for `--version` / `-V` and runtime behavior in `tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:302` and `tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:320`.

Verification:

- `deno task ci` passed (`108 passed, 0 failed`).
- `deno run -A apps/daemon/src/main.ts --version` prints `kato 0.1.0`.
- `deno run -A apps/daemon/src/main.ts -V` prints `kato 0.1.0`.

You can now bump versions independently by editing `apps/daemon/deno.json` and `apps/web/deno.json`.

Updated.

- Help output now includes:
  - `kato 0.1.0`
  - `Own your AI conversations.`
- This is applied to both `kato help` and `kato help <command>` via `apps/daemon/src/cli/usage.ts:4` and `apps/daemon/src/cli/usage.ts:71`.
- Version is set to `0.1.0` in `apps/daemon/deno.json:2`.

I also added tests for this behavior in `tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:332` and `tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:349`.

Validation:
- `deno task ci` passed (`110 passed, 0 failed`).
- `deno run -A apps/daemon/src/main.ts help` now starts with:
```text
kato 0.1.0
Own your AI conversations.
```

1. Default recording flags are now off:

- File: `apps/daemon/src/feature_flags/openfeature.ts:4`

2. Added `daemonExportEnabled` explanation in README Notes:
- File: `README.md:112`
- Also updated the sample config defaults in `README.md:98` to match the new defaults.

3. Updated tests for new defaults:
- File: `tests/openfeature-flags_test.ts:15`

Validation:
- `deno task ci` passed (`110 passed, 0 failed`).

Important for your current environment:
- This changes defaults for newly generated/backfilled config, but your existing `~/.kato/config.json` may still have old values.
- Set these in `~/.kato/config.json` and restart daemon if you want immediate behavior:
  - `featureFlags.writerIncludeThinking = false`
  - `featureFlags.writerIncludeToolCalls = false`

**Finalizing update summary**

</details>

Updated `dev-docs/notes/dev.general-guidance.md` with a new section: `## OpenFeature Guidance (How + Why)` at `dev-docs/notes/dev.general-guidance.md:94`.

It now covers:

- How it works in Kato:
  - `featureFlags` come from `~/.kato/config.json`
  - daemon uses `bootstrapOpenFeature(...)`
  - settings are resolved via `evaluateDaemonFeatureSettings(...)`
  - resolved values drive writer render options and `daemonExportEnabled`
- Why this pattern is used:
  - stable seam for future cloud/centralized providers
  - deterministic local/no-network behavior
  - explicit policy surface for sensitive/noisy output
  - fail-closed config behavior for unknown/malformed flags
- Implementation rules for adding flags:
  - update contract, defaults/evaluation, config parsing, and tests

I also ran `deno fmt` on that file.

# User_unknown-time

I don't think we need to log "Provider ingestion cursor updated" into security-audit.json. I would think we would log security-sensitive things only, like an attempt to read or write from a disallowed path or ??? -- what was the original purpose of security-audit.json ?

**Clarifying security-audit.json purpose**

</details>

Your intuition matches the original intent.

`security-audit.jsonl` was intended as a separate **audit trail for policy/control/security-relevant events**, not a duplicate of routine runtime telemetry.

Source-of-truth intent:
- `dev-docs/notes/dev.security-baseline.md:36` and `dev-docs/notes/dev.security-baseline.md:82` require auditable security-relevant allow/deny decisions.
- `dev-docs/notes/dev.security-baseline.md:95` says security audit logs must be separate from operational logs.
- `dev-docs/notes/dev.codebase-overview.md:215` describes audit as “control, policy, and security-relevant events.”
- `dev-docs/notes/dev.decision-log.md:48` set up separate operational vs security-audit sinks.

Current drift:
- We currently log `provider.ingestion.cursor_updated` to audit at `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:839`, which is operational progress, not security-sensitive.

So yes, “Provider ingestion cursor updated” is a good candidate to remove from `security-audit.jsonl` (keep it only in operational logs).  
If you want, I can patch that now and also trim similar ingestion-noise audit events in the same file.

# User_unknown-time

Yes, and also remove "Provider ingestion cursor updated" from operational.jsonl. 

The status command should include, at least, a list of currently recording sessions,  i.e., active sessions and their output destinations. Here's an example from stenobot:

  ● claude-code: "I'm considering a ground-up rewrite of Stenobot (henceforth ..."
    → /home/djradon/hub/djradon/stenobot/documentation/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-21-security-and-deno-claude.md
    Started 1 day ago · Last export 1 day ago

The session ID should be included after the provider

If you pass the --all flag to status, it should list stale sessions (and their recordings) as well.

Would love to hear your thoughts on this feature, e.g. what the best format is, best functionality, etc. The web app, let's call it kato-status-web, will use a lot of the same logic, so we should put it in shared.

Updated both the task note and the immediate log change.

## What I changed

1. Fleshed out the task doc with scope, UX, shared-model plan, implementation steps, tests, and acceptance criteria:
- `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md:9`
- Includes your requirements for:
  - removing `provider.ingestion.cursor_updated` from both logs
  - richer `kato status` session/recording list
  - `status --all` to include stale sessions/recordings
  - shared logic for daemon + `kato-status-web`

2. Removed `provider.ingestion.cursor_updated` logging emissions from ingestion runtime:
- `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:820`
- After cursor update, it now returns without writing that event to either channel.

## Validation

- `deno test --allow-read --allow-write=.kato tests/provider-ingestion_test.ts --frozen` passed.
- `deno task ci` passed (`110 passed, 0 failed`).

## My recommendations on format/functionality

- Keep `status --json` as the full, rich snapshot model; use `--all` primarily for text filtering behavior.
- In text mode, use a compact 3-line session block (provider/sessionId + snippet, destination, relative times), with `●` active and `○` stale.
- Prefer `last write` over `last export` unless we separately track one-off export timestamps (current pipeline natively tracks `lastWriteAt`).

If you want, I can implement the full status feature next following the task plan in that note.

# User_unknown-time

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

Good callout. I’ll enumerate every ingestion audit event currently emitted, classify keep/drop, and confirm whether access-failure events were included in the plan text.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Clarifying audit events kept and missing access failures**

</details>

I checked the current ingestion events and permission-denied handling paths so I can answer precisely.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Summarizing audit event decisions**

</details>

Short answer: not yet.

- I removed only `provider.ingestion.cursor_updated` from both logs.
- I did **not** add explicit access-failure audit events in code.
- In the task note, I only mentioned access denials conceptually (`dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md:48`), not as a concrete event contract.

Current ingestion access failures are still silent in several places:
- `Deno.stat` permission denied -> returns `false` with no log in `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:237`.
- `Deno.readDir` permission denied -> `continue` with no log in `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:263`.
- per-session `Deno.stat` permission denied -> skip session with no log in `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:724`.

What’s worth saving in audit:
- Keep: explicit access denials (read/write permission failures), policy allow/deny decisions.
- Probably keep: parse failures if you want tamper/corruption signal.
- Drop from audit as noise: started/stopped lifecycle and duplicate/drop counters.

If you want, I can implement a concrete `provider.ingestion.read_denied` audit event now and update the task doc acceptance criteria accordingly.

Done. I split the work exactly as requested.

- `task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md` is now status-only and points logging work to `[[task.2026.2026-02-23-awesome-logging]]`.
  - See `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md:11`
- `task.2026.2026-02-23-awesome-logging.md` now contains:
  - channel taxonomy and noise-reduction scope
  - access-failure audit events (`provider.ingestion.read_denied`)
  - runtime log-level configuration plan (config + env overrides)
  - LogLayer adoption/migration plan
  - implementation steps, tests, acceptance criteria
  - See `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-23-awesome-logging.md:9`

I also formatted both files with `deno fmt`.

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

I’ll check the CLI/export implementation and provider session parsing so I can give you exact commands to find valid `session-id` values and confirm destination flags.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Inspecting export session and output handling**

I confirmed `export` syntax. I’m checking one more thing: whether destination is required in practice at runtime when you omit `--output`, so I can give you the safe command pattern.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Clarifying export output requirement**

</details>

I have the behavior pinned down. I’ll grab exact line references for parser/runtime so the answer is unambiguous, then give you a quick test workflow.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Summarizing session ID retrieval and export commands**

</details>

Yes.

- `export` syntax is `kato export <session-id> [--output <path>]` (`-o` alias) in `apps/daemon/src/cli/parser.ts:139` and `apps/daemon/src/cli/usage.ts:60`.
- In practice right now, destination is effectively required: daemon skips export if `outputPath` is missing (`apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:821`).

Quick way to get a valid `session-id`:

1. Check provider roots in your config:
```bash
cat ~/.kato/config.json
```
Look at `providerSessionRoots.claude` and `providerSessionRoots.codex`.

2. Claude IDs (easy): ID is filename without `.jsonl` (`apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:303`)
```bash
rg --files ~/.claude/projects | rg '\.jsonl$' | head
# session-id = basename(file, ".jsonl")
```

3. Codex IDs: ID comes from `session_meta.payload.id` (`apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:396`)
```bash
rg -n '"type":"session_meta".*"id":"' ~/.codex/sessions -g '*.jsonl' | head
```
Use the `"id":"..."` value as `session-id`.

Then test:
```bash
kato export <session-id> --output ./exports/test.md
```

If you want, I can add a `kato sessions` command next so you don’t have to inspect raw provider files.
