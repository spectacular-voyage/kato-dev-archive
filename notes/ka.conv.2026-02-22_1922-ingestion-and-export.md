Plan for Phase 1 implementation:

1. Add an ingestion runtime contract module in `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator`:
   - `SessionSnapshotStore` interface with `upsert`, `get`, `list`.
   - `ProviderIngestionRunner` interface with `start`, `poll`, `stop`.
   - normalized `RuntimeSessionSnapshot` shape including provider/session/cursor, bounded messages, and status metadata.

2. Implement an in-memory `SessionSnapshotStore` with explicit retention policy:
   - default capped `maxSessions` and `maxMessagesPerSession`.
   - deterministic eviction rule (oldest untouched session first).
   - defensive cloning so callers cannot mutate store state.

3. Wire public exports:
   - export new types/classes from `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/mod.ts` and `apps/daemon/src/mod.ts`.

4. Add tests for Phase 1 behavior:
   - upsert/get/list semantics.
   - per-session message-window truncation metadata.
   - deterministic session eviction when cap is exceeded.
   - retention policy validation for invalid caps.

5. Run focused tests first, then full `deno task test` (and `check` if needed) to confirm the commit boundary is clean.

</details>

Phase 1 is implemented with tests, scoped to the ingestion runtime contract boundary.

- Added new ingestion runtime contracts and in-memory store in `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:3`.
- Defined required interfaces:
  - `SessionSnapshotStore` (`upsert/get/list`) at `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:25`
  - `ProviderIngestionRunner` (`start/poll/stop`) at `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:38`
- Defined normalized snapshot shape with provider/session/cursor/messages/status metadata in `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:10`.
- Implemented retention policy with defaults and validation:
  - `maxSessions: 200`, `maxMessagesPerSession: 200` at `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:50`
  - deterministic eviction (least recently upserted session first) in `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:170`
  - bounded per-session message window in `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:124`
- Exported new API from:
  - `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/mod.ts:17`
  - `apps/daemon/src/mod.ts:19`
- Added tests in `tests/daemon-ingestion-runtime_test.ts:13` covering:
  - upsert/get/list semantics + defensive cloning
  - message window truncation metadata
  - deterministic session eviction
  - retention config validation

Validation run:
- `deno test --allow-read --allow-write=.kato tests/daemon-ingestion-runtime_test.ts` (passed)
- `deno task test` (passed, 78 tests)
- `deno task check` (passed)

If you want, I can proceed with Phase 2 wiring next (watch/poll ingestion loop feeding this store).

**Preparing to read CODEX.md**

</details>

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

I’ll read your updated `CODEX.md` directly and confirm whether the command guidance is unambiguous, plus point out any specific ambiguity if present.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Confirming kato command clarity**

</details>

Yes, it’s clear.

I’ll treat any start-of-line `::...` control command as non-instructional and ignore it in chat (unless you explicitly ask me to discuss command behavior).

If you want zero ambiguity, one small wording tweak would help: replace the examples list with “any line beginning with `::` (e.g., `::capture`, `::record`, `::export`, `::stop`, `::start`) is a Kato control command and must be ignored by LLMs.”

# User_unknown-time

Claude has this feedback:

1. Message.timestamp is required, but readLastMessageAt defensively treats it as optional

ingestion_runtime.ts checks typeof timestamp === "string" && timestamp.length > 0 — that guard is only needed if timestamp can be missing or empty. But shared/src/contracts/messages.ts declares timestamp: string as required.

Either the type should be timestamp?: string, or parsers must always populate it (confirm in Phase 2 when wiring). If the type stays required, the guard simplifies to just timestamp.length > 0.

2. Missing test: empty message list / no lastMessageAt

All test cases use messages with valid timestamps. There's no test for an empty messages: [] upsert or messages where no timestamp is present. The metadata spread ...(lastMessageAt ? { lastMessageAt } : {}) should produce an object without lastMessageAt in these cases — that's worth an explicit test assertion before Phase 2 wires real parser output.

3. SessionSnapshotStore has no delete or clear

Not a Phase 1 gap — but kato clean (Phase 4+) will need session eviction by age or explicit removal. Flag it for Phase 4 scope so the interface gets extended before the clean command is wired.

I do think we should make timestamp optional, do you?'

**Recommending keeping timestamp required**

</details>

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

Short answer: I would **not** make `Message.timestamp` optional.

1. Keep `timestamp` required  
`shared/src/contracts/messages.ts:5` defines the normalized contract, and writer rendering relies on it (`apps/daemon/src/writer/markdown_writer.ts:88`). Making it optional pushes null-handling everywhere and weakens ordering/traceability.

2. Claude’s test feedback is valid  
We should add a test for `messages: []` asserting `metadata.lastMessageAt` is absent in `tests/daemon-ingestion-runtime_test.ts`. That’s a good Phase 1 hardening add.

3. `delete/clear` on `SessionSnapshotStore`  
Agreed this is a future interface need for `clean`; I’d track it explicitly in the Phase 4 scope before wiring cleanup behavior.

I’d keep the defensive `readLastMessageAt` guard even with required types, since runtime data can still be malformed despite TS types. If you want, I can patch in the missing empty-message test and add the Phase 4 interface note now.

**Refining task checklist structure**

I’m patching the checklist to mark Phase 1 complete and split Phase 5 test bullets so the completed unit-test item is explicitly checked without over-marking future work.

<details>

**Summarizing final doc change**

</details>

Done. I updated the checklist in `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-ingestion-and-export.md` to reflect completed work:

- Marked all Phase 1 items `[x]`.
- In Phase 5 unit tests, marked `ingestion store upsert/get/list semantics` as `[x]` and left the other unit-test items unchecked.

No code/tests were run since this was a task-note update only.

**Summarizing timestamp handling**

</details>

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

Current behavior is:

- `Message.timestamp` is required by contract in `shared/src/contracts/messages.ts:5`.
- In ingestion metadata, `readLastMessageAt` scans backward and returns the first non-empty timestamp; if none, it returns `undefined` (`apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:101`).
- `upsert` then omits `metadata.lastMessageAt` entirely when that happens (`apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/ingestion_runtime.ts:139`).

If a timestamp is missing/invalid at runtime:

1. Store still accepts the message.
2. `metadata.lastMessageAt` is absent.
3. Export/render still works; heading time becomes `unknown-time` (`apps/daemon/src/writer/markdown_writer.ts:48`).

So it degrades gracefully, it does not crash.

Also:
- Claude parser uses source timestamps.
- Codex parser currently synthesizes timestamps at parse time (`apps/daemon/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:56`).

I’d keep `timestamp` required and enforce/synthesize it in parsers during Phase 2, rather than making it optional everywhere.

I’m first checking config/runtime surfaces to choose the clean integration point.

- Wired default Claude+Codex ingestion runners into subprocess startup in `apps/daemon/src/main.ts:73`.
- Exported new APIs in `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/mod.ts:31` and `apps/daemon/src/mod.ts:19`.
- Added/updated tests:
  - provider ingestion behavior (watch/poll, parse errors, duplicate suppression, Claude/Codex wiring): `tests/provider-ingestion_test.ts:90`
  - runtime runner lifecycle integration: `tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts:494`
  - empty-message metadata edge case (`lastMessageAt` omitted): `tests/daemon-ingestion-runtime_test.ts:84`

**Task note updates**
- Marked all Phase 2 items complete in `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-ingestion-and-export.md:47`.
- Marked unit test item “cursor resume and duplicate-suppression behavior” complete in `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-ingestion-and-export.md:74`.

**Validation**
- `deno task test` passed (`85 passed, 0 failed`).
- `deno task check` passed.

Phase 3 is implemented.

- Wired runtime export to live session snapshots:
  - `apps/daemon/src/main.ts:117` now passes `loadSessionSnapshot` backed by `InMemorySessionSnapshotStore`.
- Made snapshot loading canonical in runtime export flow:
  - `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:37`
  - export path prefers `loadSessionSnapshot`; legacy `loadSessionMessages` is explicit and logged.
- Added safe missing/empty-session behavior (no silent empty writes):
  - `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:261`
  - new warning/audit events:
    - `daemon.control.export.session_missing`
    - `daemon.control.export.empty`
    - `daemon.control.export.invalid_snapshot`
    - `daemon.control.export.legacy_loader`
- Kept provider identity real for canonical path (uses snapshot provider, no `"unknown"` fallback there):
  - `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:353`

Tests added/updated:

- `tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts:387` missing-session export skips safely.
- `tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts:524` empty-session export skips safely.
- `tests/daemon-main_test.ts:53` verifies subprocess wiring includes snapshot loader.

Task checklist updated:

- Phase 3 items checked in `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-ingestion-and-export.md:54`.
- Phase 5 export-related test items updated in `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-ingestion-and-export.md:72`.

Validation:

- `deno task test` passed (`87 passed, 0 failed`).
- `deno task check` passed.

1. If you want, I’ll proceed to Phase 4 (`status.providers` from live snapshot store).

# User_unknown-time

Claude's notes:

1. Loggers in main.ts use NoopSink — all operational/audit output is silently discarded

main.ts:75-86 creates both operationalLogger and auditLogger with NoopSink. Every structured log event — ingestion started, cursor updated, parse errors, export decisions, daemon started/stopped — goes nowhere. The infrastructure is all wired, but the daemon produces zero observable output in production.

This needs real sinks (file sinks or stdout/stderr) before Phase 5 testing. Otherwise the smoke runbook has nothing to observe.

2. void on async log calls inside dedupeDiscoveredSessions

provider_ingestion.ts:698 and line 707 use void this.operationalLogger.warn(...) and void this.auditLogger.record(...). These are fire-and-forget — if logging fails, it fails silently. The rest of the codebase consistently awaits log calls. This is inconsistent and could silently eat errors. The reason is likely that dedupeDiscoveredSessions is a private sync-ish method — but it's actually async and could await these.

3. Cursor persistence not implemented — daemon restart re-parses from offset 0

After a daemon restart, this.cursors is empty. Every session is re-ingested from byte 0. mergeMessages deduplicates against the snapshot store's existing messages, so no double-storage occurs — but large conversation files will be fully re-parsed on every restart. This is an accepted MVP limitation, but it should be explicitly called out in the known limits section of the task doc (it currently only mentions recording pipeline being lost on restart, not cursors).

Minor Notes
No test for empty/missing watch roots: When HOME is not set or watch roots don't exist, the watch is skipped and only polling runs. This path isn't explicitly tested. Low priority.
Ingestion runner start() sets this.started = true before async operations: If a logger call throws after started = true, poll() would still proceed. Acceptable for MVP.
Phase 4 (status.providers): Still empty — not populated from the snapshot store yet. Expected, since Phase 4 is next.

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

I agree with those notes. I’ll implement the concrete fixes now: switch daemon runtime loggers in `main.ts` from `NoopSink` to real file sinks, make dedupe logging awaited, and add an explicit restart-cursor limitation note in the task doc. Then I’ll rerun tests/check.

I’m applying those fixes directly: switching daemon loggers to real JSONL file sinks, making dedupe logging awaited, and adding an explicit cursor-persistence limitation note in the task doc. Then I’ll rerun tests/check.

**Summarizing addressed notes and next steps**

</details>

Applied all of that feedback.

1. Real daemon log sinks (no more `NoopSink` in subprocess runtime)
- `apps/daemon/src/main.ts:76` now writes operational logs to `runtimeDir/logs/operational.jsonl`.
- `apps/daemon/src/main.ts:81` now writes audit logs to `runtimeDir/logs/security-audit.jsonl`.
- Verified with a new test in `tests/daemon-main_test.ts:90`.

2. Removed fire-and-forget logging in dedupe path
- `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:649` now awaits dedupe path.
- `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:676` made dedupe async.
- `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:698` and `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:707` now `await` logger calls (no `void`).

3. Documented restart cursor limitation explicitly
- Added a `Known MVP Limitations` section at `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-ingestion-and-export.md:111`.
- It now explicitly states cursors are in-memory only and restart reparses from offset `0`.

4. Also covered your minor test gap
- Added missing-roots behavior test in `tests/provider-ingestion_test.ts:223`.

Validation:
- `deno task test` passed (`89 passed, 0 failed`).
- `deno task check` passed.

1. Next logical step is Phase 4 (`status.providers` from live snapshot store).

# User_unknown-time

Ok, let's proceed with phase 4

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Designing provider status updates**

</details>

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

I’m implementing Phase 4 now by wiring `status.providers` from the live session snapshot store in the runtime loop, with a stale threshold so provider counts reset when snapshots age out. Then I’ll add runtime tests for both fresh and stale cases.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Acknowledging phase4 start and inspecting files**

</details>

Proceeding with Phase 4 now. I’ll first validate the current Phase 4 edits against the task note, then run tests/check and fix anything failing before I update the checklist items.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Inspecting runtime and tests**

</details>

I confirmed the Phase 4 task items are still unchecked and found the new runtime/test hooks already present. Next I’m inspecting the exact runtime/status logic and test coverage, then I’ll run the suite and patch any gaps.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Inspecting new daemon-runtime tests**

</details>

I’ve verified the main wiring and logging sink changes are in place. I’m now reading the new daemon runtime tests to ensure Phase 4 behavior is fully asserted and that stale/reset semantics are covered correctly.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Inspecting timestamp optionality in contracts**

</details>

I’ve confirmed Phase 4 tests were added for provider aggregation and stale filtering. I’m now checking ingestion/message contracts and dedupe logging paths for consistency with the earlier timestamp and async-logging decisions.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Confirming timestamp handling and preparing formatting**

</details>

I’m moving to validation now: format touched Phase 4 files, run targeted tests, then full `deno task test` and `deno task check` to confirm no regressions.

<details>

**Running targeted Deno tests**

</details>

<details>

**Adjusting test run for permissions**

</details>

Targeted `deno test` failed due missing explicit write permissions (`NotCapable`) rather than code behavior. I’ll validate with the project task runner (`deno task test` / `deno task check`) which is the canonical path in this repo.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Running final checks**

</details>

The Phase 4 tests are green under `deno task test`. I’m running `deno task check` now to confirm type/lint integrity before I mark task items complete.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Summarizing Phase 4 completion**

</details>

Phase 4 is implemented and validated.

- `status.providers` is now computed from live session snapshots with aggregation by provider (`activeSessions`) and newest `lastMessageAt`: `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:96`, `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:271`.
- Stale/reset semantics are implemented via `providerStatusStaleAfterMs` (default 5 minutes), excluding stale snapshots from provider status: `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:51`, `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:158`, `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:273`.
- Runtime wiring uses the in-memory snapshot store for status/export paths: `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:179`, `apps/daemon/src/main.ts:101`, `apps/daemon/src/main.ts:130`.
- Added/updated Phase 4 tests:
  - provider counts + latest timestamp aggregation: `tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts:861`
  - stale provider filtering/reset behavior: `tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts:1011`
- Task checklist updated with Phase 4 items checked, plus the runtime status test item in Phase 5: `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-ingestion-and-export.md:74`.

Validation:
- `deno task test` passed (`91 passed, 0 failed`).
- `deno task check` passed.

Next natural step is Phase 5’s remaining item: update `dev.testing.md` smoke runbook for provider-ingestion + real export.

# User_unknown-time

I noticed in @dev.codebase-ocerview it talks about the policy layer, but not about the read-path. I'd thought the daemon would be spawned with read access specified in config, ie. the provide folders.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Preparing read access investigation**

</details>

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

You’re right to flag that. I’m checking the actual runtime config, launcher permissions, and provider ingestion discovery paths so I can confirm whether read access is currently policy-controlled or just implicit.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Inspecting root resolution logic**

</details>

You’re correct: right now read access is not constrained by config. I’m pulling the ingestion root resolution details so I can tell you exactly what paths are used and what is configurable today.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Checking runtime config contract**

</details>

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Planning doc updates on read access**

</details>

You’re remembering correctly from intended architecture; the current implementation still has a gap there. I’m grabbing exact file references so we can decide whether to treat this as Phase 6 documentation only or a code change.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Clarifying read-path policy and docs**

</details>

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Clarifying current read permission design**

</details>

You’re right; current behavior does not enforce read roots from config yet.

- Daemon launch uses unrestricted read permission: `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/launcher.ts:40` (`--allow-read`).
- Only write is config-scoped: `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/launcher.ts:41`, with values from `allowedWriteRoots` in `shared/src/contracts/config.ts:15` and wired in `apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts:209`.
- `RuntimeConfig` has no read-root field today: `shared/src/contracts/config.ts:10`.
- Provider ingestion roots come from env/defaults, not runtime config:
  - `KATO_CLAUDE_SESSION_ROOTS` / defaults in `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:204`
  - `KATO_CODEX_SESSION_ROOTS` / defaults in `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:225`

So the policy layer is effectively write-path policy right now; read-path is implicit via ingestion root resolution plus broad `--allow-read`.  

If you want, I can implement the intended model next: add config-backed read roots and pass `--allow-read=<provider roots + runtime/config paths>` at launch.

# User_unknown-time

Sure, give it a try. Also, Claude feedback:

1. Provider status recomputed on every poll, not just at heartbeat

daemon_runtime.ts:183-189 calls sessionSnapshotStore.list() on every loop iteration (default every 1 second). list() returns structuredClone of all snapshots. With 200 sessions × 200 messages × 1s poll interval, this is a lot of cloning — 5× per heartbeat flush. The recomputed providers value is only saved to disk at heartbeat time anyway.

For MVP session counts this won't be noticeable, but a simple guard would avoid the redundant work:

// only recompute providers when there's something to compute
if (sessionSnapshotStore) {
  providers = toProviderStatuses(...)
}
Or move the provider computation inside the heartbeat block. Flag for post-MVP or if load testing reveals it.

2. Missing test: toProviderStatuses with a session that has no lastMessageAt

Both tests use sessions with lastMessageAt populated. There's no test asserting that lastMessageAt is absent from the output ProviderStatus when all a provider's sessions have no lastMessageAt. The spread conditional ...(status.lastMessageAt ? { lastMessageAt } : {}) handles this correctly, but it's not exercised.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Planning config and feedback implementation**

</details>

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

I’ll implement config-backed read roots end-to-end (contract, init/load validation, launcher permissions, ingestion wiring), then fold in Claude’s two runtime feedback items with tests and docs updates. I’m starting by mapping current config/default paths and tests to avoid breaking schema compatibility.

**Designing provider roots config**

Plan for this pass:

1. Add config-backed provider read roots
- Extend `RuntimeConfig` with `providerSessionRoots` (`claude`/`codex`).
- Backfill defaults for legacy configs, with validation and deep-clone safety.
- Wire those roots into daemon startup ingestion runner options.

2. Enforce narrowed daemon read permissions at launch
- Update detached launcher to use `--allow-read=<scoped roots>` instead of broad `--allow-read`.
- Include runtime/config/control/status paths, allowed write roots (writer read-before-write), and provider session roots.
- Propagate provider roots through CLI runtime context.

3. Address Claude runtime feedback
- Move provider status recompute to heartbeat/final-save points (not every poll loop).
- Add test coverage for provider status output when `lastMessageAt` is absent.

4. Update docs/tasks and verify
- Update `dev.codebase-overview.md` to describe read-path model and current ingestion wiring.
- Update task checklist items touched by this pass.
- Run `deno fmt`, `deno task test`, `deno task check`.

Implemented. Read-path is now config-backed for provider folders, and I applied both Claude feedback items.

**Code changes**
- Added provider read roots to config contract: `shared/src/contracts/config.ts:10`.
- Added config defaults/backfill/validation for `providerSessionRoots` (`claude`, `codex`): `apps/daemon/src/config/runtime_config.ts:147`, `apps/daemon/src/config/runtime_config.ts:253`, `apps/daemon/src/config/runtime_config.ts:315`.
- Propagated provider roots through CLI runtime context: `apps/daemon/src/cli/types.ts:35`, `apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts:210`.
- Detached daemon launcher now uses scoped read permissions (`--allow-read=<roots>`) instead of broad read: `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/launcher.ts:36`, `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/launcher.ts:45`.
- Daemon subprocess ingestion now uses roots from runtime config: `apps/daemon/src/main.ts:103`.
- Provider runner root resolution now honors explicit empty overrides (no fallback): `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:204`, `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:225`.
- Claude feedback #1 addressed: provider status recompute moved off every poll; now computed on heartbeat save and shutdown save: `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:281`, `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:320`.
- Claude feedback #2 addressed: added test for provider status with no `lastMessageAt`: `tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts:1011`.

**Tests**
- Added/updated coverage for launcher read scope and provider roots env wiring: `tests/daemon-launcher_test.ts:48`.
- Added/updated runtime config tests for provider roots backfill, cloning, and invalid shape rejection: `tests/runtime-config_test.ts:35`, `tests/runtime-config_test.ts:76`, `tests/runtime-config_test.ts:142`.
- Minor lint-safe tweak in existing parse-error test helper: `tests/provider-ingestion_test.ts:195`.

- Security guidance updated for read/write scope from runtime config: `dev-docs/notes/dev.general-guidance.md:87`.
- Smoke runbook now includes provider-ingestion + real export scenario: `dev-docs/notes/dev.testing.md:65`, `dev-docs/notes/dev.testing.md:107`.
- Phase 5 checklist marked complete in task note: `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-ingestion-and-export.md:84`.

**Validation**
- `deno task test` passed.
- `deno task check` passed.
- `deno task ci` passed.

# User_unknown-time

One issue: The README config example at README.md:68-84 no longer reflects the actual default config shape — it's missing providerSessionRoots. When a user runs kato init, the generated config will include it, but the README example doesn't. This should be updated before Phase 5 (smoke runbook).

**Summarizing README update details**

</details>

Updated.

- Added `providerSessionRoots` to the runtime config example in `README.md:72`.
- Added a clarifying note that `providerSessionRoots` drives ingestion discovery roots and daemon read-scope narrowing in `README.md:102`.

I used `<HOME>/...` placeholders in the example so the shape matches `kato init` while staying platform-neutral.

# User_unknown-time

If you provide providerSessionRoots: { "claude": [...] } without codex, value["codex"] is undefined, Array.isArray(undefined) is false, and the whole config is rejected.

Compare this to how featureFlags parsing works — absent keys are filled in with defaults via mergeRuntimeFeatureFlags. providerSessionRoots could do the same using the existing mergeProviderSessionRoots function, which already handles partial overrides correctly.

The current behavior is strictly more restrictive than it needs to be, and it's inconsistent with the featureFlags pattern. A user who only has Claude Code installed and wants to customize its paths shouldn't need to also specify Codex paths.

The fix would be to replace the strict loop in parseProviderSessionRoots with mergeProviderSessionRoots semantics — accept a partial object, merge absent keys with env/defaults. The unknown-key rejection (the Object.keys check above the loop) would still catch typos.

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

Good catch. I’ll switch `parseProviderSessionRoots` to accept partial objects and merge missing keys from defaults/env (same pattern as `featureFlags`), then add a regression test for a Claude-only override.

I’ve applied the parser/test changes. I’m running format and validation now to confirm the new partial-merge behavior is clean and covered.

Fixed.

- `parseProviderSessionRoots` now accepts partial objects and merges missing provider keys from defaults/env via `mergeProviderSessionRoots`, while still rejecting unknown keys: `apps/daemon/src/config/runtime_config.ts:180`.
- Added regression coverage for Claude-only override with Codex default merge: `tests/runtime-config_test.ts:176`.
- Existing invalid-shape rejection test remains: `tests/runtime-config_test.ts:142`.

Validation:
- `deno task test` passed (`94 passed, 0 failed`).

That behavior is plausible right now, and usually comes from one of two things:

1. You’re in a **restricted/untrusted workspace**.  
In VS Code, Gemini docs say agent auto-allow only works in a **trusted workspace**; restricted workspaces still prompt.  
2. Agent mode is still **Preview**, and approvals can be tool-specific/session-fragile (for example, switching between `ReadFileTool` and `ReadManyFilesTool`).

What to do:

1. In VS Code, trust the folder: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `Workspaces: Manage Workspace Trust` → Trust.
2. Enable full auto-allow for agent mode in User Settings JSON:
```json
"geminicodeassist.agentYoloMode": true
```
Then run `Developer: Reload Window`.
3. Stay in the same agent chat/session (new chat or reload can reset temporary approvals).
4. Update Gemini Code Assist extension to latest.
5. If it still prompts every read, file feedback from the extension (include extension version + screenshot of the exact prompt text), because this is likely a Preview bug/limitation.

But I'd like even more depth about the various components and what their responsbilities and inter-relationships are. You can tackle that before or after the documentation updates for Phase 6

**Reviewing docs and task note**

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

I’ll take this now by deepening `dev.codebase-overview.md` with a clearer component map, responsibilities, and cross-component data flow, then I’ll sync the Phase 6 task note status so docs progress is explicit.

**Expanding codebase overview depth**

</details>

I’m now rewriting `dev.codebase-overview.md` with a deeper architecture map: explicit ownership boundaries, subsystem responsibilities, and end-to-end interaction flows (ingest/status/export/control). Then I’ll quickly sanity-check formatting and update the task note phase status only if needed.

**Summarizing docs-only update**

</details>

Expanded `dev.codebase-overview.md` with much deeper component documentation, focused on responsibilities and relationships.

What I added in `dev-docs/notes/dev.codebase-overview.md`:
- Purpose + architecture scope
- Refined core vocabulary and boundaries
- System topology diagram (CLI, launcher, runtime, ingestion, writer, policy, control plane, logs)
- Responsibility matrix (who owns what state, reads, writes, modules)
- Daemon subsystem deep dive (CLI/router, launcher permissions, runtime loop, ingestion, snapshot store, export path, policy, observability)
- Source-of-truth boundaries
- Key interaction flows (ingestion->status, ingestion->export, stop/stale recovery)
- Test-coverage map by concern
- Extension guide (add provider, add command)
- Current MVP limits

I also updated Phase 6 progress in `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-ingestion-and-export.md:97`:
- marked `dev.general-guidance`, `dev.codebase-overview`, and `dev.decision-log` as done
- left `dev.todo` as pending

No code behavior changed in this pass, so I didn’t rerun the test suite for this docs-only update.

# User_unknown-time

ok, you can remove (as opposed to x-ing) completed items from [dev.todo.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/dev.todo.md) and make any obvious additions.

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

I’ll audit `dev.todo.md` against the work we’ve completed in ingestion/export, delete completed items (not just check them), then add only high-signal follow-ups that are clearly still open.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Planning comprehensive todo update**

</details>

I found `dev.todo.md` is still carrying a lot of now-completed ingestion/export items, so I’m pruning it down to active backlog only and adding the highest-priority follow-ups (cursor persistence, snapshot deletion/clean wiring, and permission-boundary tests).

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Marking tasks completed**

</details>

I also need to close the matching Phase 6 checkbox in the ingestion/export task note now that `dev.todo` is updated; I’m applying that so tracking stays consistent.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Summarizing final changes**

</details>

Done.

I pruned `dev-docs/notes/dev.todo.md` by removing completed ingestion/export items and kept only active backlog, with obvious additions:

- cursor persistence across restarts
- `SessionSnapshotStore` `delete`/`clear` + `clean` wiring
- provider read-scope permission-boundary tests
- config compatibility/versioning updates for `providerSessionRoots`
- compiled-runtime permission-profile smoke coverage

Updated file: `dev-docs/notes/dev.todo.md:11`.

I also marked Phase 6 fully complete in the task note since `dev.todo` is now updated:

- `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-ingestion-and-export.md:97`.

No code logic changed, so I did not run test/check for this docs-only pass.

Wasn't there a way to force an init

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Investigating CLI init force option**

</details>

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

I’ll check the CLI parser and `init` command behavior to confirm whether a force flag exists and what the exact workaround is.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Clarifying init force option**

</details>

Not currently. There is no `init --force` path in the CLI right now.

- `kato init` is idempotent (`ensureInitialized`): it creates config only if missing.
- `kato start` can auto-init only when missing (`KATO_AUTO_INIT_ON_START=true`).

If you want to “force” re-init today, do:

```bash
mv .kato/config.json .kato/config.json.bak
deno run -A apps/daemon/src/main.ts init
```

(Use `KATO_CONFIG_PATH` if you’re using a non-default config location.)

If you want, I can add a real `kato init --force` command next.

# User_unknown-time

**Assessing runtime directory resolution**

</details>

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

Understood. I’ll check the runtime path defaults and make them home-directory based so the default location is `~/.kato` instead of project-local `.kato`. Then I’ll update docs/tests accordingly.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Assessing default runtime dir change**

</details>

You’re right, and current defaults are still project-local. I’ll switch default runtime/config paths to `~/.kato` and update any docs/usages that still imply local `.kato` defaults. I’ll keep explicit overrides via env/config working as-is.

You want Kato’s default state under `~/.kato` instead of project-local `.kato`. I’m checking current code/docs wiring now and will patch any remaining references to make `~/.kato` the default while keeping `KATO_RUNTIME_DIR` overrides intact.

<details>

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Summarizing changes and commit offer**

</details>

Default path now resolves to `~/.kato` (not project-local) for normal runs.

What changed:
- `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/control_plane.ts`: default runtime dir is now `<HOME>/.kato/runtime` (or `<USERPROFILE>/.kato/runtime` on Windows).
- `KATO_RUNTIME_DIR` still takes precedence if set.
- Fallback remains `.kato/runtime` only when env access is unavailable (mainly restricted test contexts).
- `apps/daemon/src/cli/usage.ts`: `init` help text now points to `~/.kato/config.json`.
- `README.md`, `dev-docs/notes/dev.testing.md`, `dev-docs/notes/dev.codebase-overview.md`: updated to `~/.kato/...` paths.

Validation:
- `deno task test` passed.
- `deno task check` passed.

If you want, I can make this a dedicated commit now (clean boundary: runtime default path + docs).

You’re flagging the right edge case. I’ll verify where that absolute `/home/<user>` string is coming from (docs vs generated config), then either adjust docs or add `~` expansion support so the behavior is cross-platform and unambiguous.

**Summarizing config shorthand changes**

</details>

Good catch. I changed it so default config uses `~` shorthand, and runtime expands it correctly.

What I changed:
- `apps/daemon/src/config/runtime_config.ts:82` and `apps/daemon/src/config/runtime_config.ts:238`  
  - Added `~` expansion for `runtimeDir`, `statusPath`, `controlPath`, and `allowedWriteRoots` when loading config.
  - Supports both `~/...` and `~\\...`.
- `apps/daemon/src/config/runtime_config.ts:341`  
  - Added `useHomeShorthand` option to `createDefaultRuntimeConfig`.
  - When enabled, defaults are serialized with `~` (including provider roots).
- `apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts:134`  
  - `kato init`/auto-init now creates default config with `useHomeShorthand: true`.
- `apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts:190`  
  - After auto-init on `start`, CLI reloads config so shorthand is resolved before runtime uses paths.
- `README.md:78`  
  - Config example now shows `~/.kato/...` paths.

Validation:
- `deno task test` passed.
- `deno task check` passed.

Absolute paths like `/home/<user>/...` still work, but defaults now write `~` so it stays home-relative and OS-portable.

# User_unknown-time

I have several coderabbit suggestions. 

This first one, I think we should just remove csv complexity entirely, it seems like it'd never be used.

"Verify each finding against the current code and only fix it if needed.

In `@apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts` around lines 178 - 202,
parseRootsFromEnv currently falls back to CSV when JSON.parse succeeds but the
array contains invalid entries; instead, when JSON.parse returns an array,
filter it with isNonEmptyString, pass the filtered array to normalizeRoots and
return that if non-empty, and only perform the CSV fallback when JSON.parse
throws (i.e., raw is not valid JSON). Update parseRootsFromEnv to (1) use
readEnvOptional and JSON.parse as before, (2) if parsed is an array, filter with
isNonEmptyString and normalizeRoots(filtered) and return when non-empty, and (3)
only split raw by commas into CSV when JSON.parse threw; reference
parseRootsFromEnv, isNonEmptyString, normalizeRoots, and readEnvOptional to
locate the changes."

**Preparing to inspect CSV fallback**

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

Verified and fixed.

- The finding was valid in current code: `parseRootsFromEnv` in `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:178` would parse CSV for multiple non-JSON-array cases.
- I removed CSV support there entirely. It now:
  - reads env via `readEnvOptional`
  - `JSON.parse`s
  - requires an array
  - filters with `isNonEmptyString`
  - normalizes and returns only non-empty results  
  See `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:178`.
- Validation passed:
  - `deno task test`
  - `deno task check`

One note: `apps/daemon/src/config/runtime_config.ts` still has its own CSV fallback parser. If you want “no CSV anywhere,” I can remove it there next.

**Summarizing CSV removal rationale**

Removed.

- `apps/daemon/src/config/runtime_config.ts:136` now parses `KATO_CLAUDE_SESSION_ROOTS` / `KATO_CODEX_SESSION_ROOTS` as JSON arrays only (no CSV fallback).
- `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/provider_ingestion.ts:178` already matches the same JSON-only behavior.

Why CSV would have existed:
- Mainly convenience/back-compat for env vars typed by hand.
- In this codebase it adds ambiguity and weak validation without a clear practical benefit, so dropping it is cleaner.

Validation:
- `deno task test` passed.
- `deno task check` passed.

# User_unknown-time

another coderabbit suggestion:

Verify each finding against the current code and only fix it if needed.

In `@apps/daemon/src/writer/markdown_writer.ts` around lines 187 - 245, The dedupe
signature in renderMessagesToMarkdown currently ignores whether tool calls or
thinking blocks changed, so messages with same id/timestamp but updated
tool/thinking content are skipped; update the signature calculation in
renderMessagesToMarkdown to incorporate the message's tool-call and thinking
content (or at least their presence/version) by including relevant fields when
building signature (e.g., message.toolCalls, message.thinking, or the rendered
result used by formatMessage) and respect includeToolCalls/includeThinking flags
so changes in those blocks produce a different signature and prevent erroneous

Finding is valid against current code.

# User_unknown-time

This isn't a huge deal: but I'm torn about what to do about it:

Verify each finding against the current code and only fix it if needed.

In `@dev-docs/notes/conv.2026-02-22_1922-ingestion-and-export.md` around lines 9 -
10, The file contains duplicate Markdown headings (e.g., the heading text
"User_2026-02-22_1929_37" appears more than once and also again around lines
46-48), which triggers MD024; locate the repeated heading(s) and either make the
second occurrence unique (rename it to a distinct heading) or convert the
duplicate heading into plain paragraph text so the heading text is no longer
duplicated; update any related references or anchors if you rename the heading
to keep links intact.

--- 

i.e., we don't need to fix this particular file, but what if two messages happen in the same second? Should we / can we roll them under the same header?

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

**Advising on duplicate heading handling**

</details>

# gpt-5.3-codex_unknown-time

You can, but I would not roll non-consecutive messages under one header.

Current behavior in `renderMessagesToMarkdown`:
- Heading key is `role + timestamp` rounded to seconds.
- A new heading is only emitted when role changes.

So:
- Consecutive same-role messages are already grouped under one heading.
- Duplicate headings happen when the same role appears again in the same second later in the thread.

Recommendation:
1. Keep turn boundaries as-is (don’t merge non-consecutive messages).
2. Make headings unique instead of merging:
   - append a short suffix (best: from `message.id`), or
   - include milliseconds if present.
3. If these conversation capture files are archival/generated, it’s also reasonable to exclude them from MD024 lint.

If you want, I can patch heading generation to add a short stable suffix so MD024 stops firing without changing grouping behavior.
