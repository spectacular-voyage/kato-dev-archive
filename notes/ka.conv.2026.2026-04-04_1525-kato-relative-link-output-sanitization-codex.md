kato relative link output sanitization

Please review [[task.2026.2026-04-04-relative-link-output-sanitization]] 
I say we silently change existing workspaces. Everyone wants this. But yes, workspace scaffold output needs to include this and the wikilnks flag too.

Don't mess with existing output. Twins shouldn't need any changes. Have you seen any reference-style links or raw autolinks in conv output?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1418_23

I’m reviewing the task note and the repo guidance first, then I’ll trace current link-generation behavior so I can answer the migration question concretely rather than guessing.

I’ve got the task note and the current writer tests in view now. Next I’m checking the config/scaffold paths and the actual `conv.*` corpus so I can separate “what we want” from “what the repo currently emits.”

I’ve confirmed the first important split: twins do not need changes, but persisted workspace output state probably does if this follows the existing writer-flag pattern. I’m checking those contracts now so I can call out the exact boundary instead of lumping “persisted data” together.

I’ve verified the config boundary. The workspace scaffold already includes `writerUseDendronStyleWikilinks: false`, and any new writer flag will also need session-state plumbing if you want live outputs to stay stable across daemon reloads. I’m doing one more pass on the `conv.*` corpus to answer the link-syntax question with examples instead of hunches.

I’ve got two concrete review points now: the rollout/default story is internally inconsistent, and the persisted-output compatibility story is under-specified. I’m patching the task note so those decisions are explicit and testable rather than buried as assumptions.

I’m editing the note now. The changes are narrow: clarify default-on rollout for future renders, keep old files/twins untouched, make scaffold values explicit, and document that inline links stay in scope while bare URLs stay out.

The task note is updated. I’m doing a quick read-back pass now to make sure the rollout language is coherent and doesn’t accidentally imply twin migration or retroactive file rewrites.

There was one remaining ambiguity in the note: “session metadata stays as persisted” reads too broadly now that writer-flag compatibility is part of the contract. I’m tightening that wording so it only protects authoritative path/history data, not every metadata field.

I’ve finished the note cleanup. I’m grabbing exact line references now so the review summary can point to the concrete contract and compatibility spots instead of hand-waving.

**Findings**
- The original task note had the wrong rollout default for the product decision you described. It said not to silently change existing workspaces, but the current writer-flag model already centers defaults in [registry.ts:448](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/runtime/src/workspace/registry.ts#L448) and explicit scaffold output in [registry.ts:900](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/runtime/src/workspace/registry.ts#L900). I updated the note so future renders in existing workspaces without the new key sanitize links, while old markdown files and twins are left alone. Refs: [[task.2026.2026-04-04-relative-link-output-sanitization#L35]], [[task.2026.2026-04-04-relative-link-output-sanitization#L159]], [[task.2026.2026-04-04-relative-link-output-sanitization#L176]].
- The original note was underspecified for persisted workspace output state. Runtime can resolve writer flags from live workspace config or fall back to persisted `output.writerFeatureFlags` in [daemon_runtime.ts:548](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts#L548), and that persisted contract lives in [session_state.ts:60](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/shared/src/contracts/session_state.ts#L60). Without an explicit pre-flag compatibility rule, reload behavior would be inconsistent. I added that rule in [[task.2026.2026-04-04-relative-link-output-sanitization#L207]].

I also folded in the scaffold point. The scaffold already emits `writerUseDendronStyleWikilinks: false` in [registry.ts:923](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/runtime/src/workspace/registry.ts#L923); the task note now says the new scaffold should emit `writerRelativizeLocalLinks: true` alongside it in [[task.2026.2026-04-04-relative-link-output-sanitization#L203]].

On the syntax question: I did not find reference-style link definitions or literal `<https://...>` autolink syntax in `conv.*`. I did find plenty of bare/plain URLs, mostly external citations or localhost examples, for example [[ka.conv.2026.2026-02-22_1922-ingestion-and-export#L454]] and [[ka.conv.2026.2026-03-07_0717-kato-web-codex#L286]]. So keeping bare URLs out of scope for this task is reasonable.

I did not run tests; this was a task-note edit only.

# djradon_2026-04-04_1423_21

OK, ready to implement?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1423_36

I’m implementing this now. First I’m tracing the current writer, runtime, and config plumbing so I can add the new default/compatibility behavior without regressing the Dendron path.

I’ve confirmed the main fault lines: the writer currently only has a style switch, not an output-path-aware sanitization mode, and both daemon/web build render options from persisted writer flags. Next I’m reading the writer class and the existing tests that exercise those paths so I can patch this once.

# djradon_2026-04-04_1423_51

Maybe update the "Open issues"

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1424_05

I’m tightening the task note rather than starting code changes. The current `Open Issues` section still mixes resolved positions with real uncertainty, so I’m converting it into a short “no blockers / follow-up risk” section.

Updated `Open Issues` in [[task.2026.2026-04-04-relative-link-output-sanitization]] to match the current state.

It now says there are no blocking product/design issues for this slice, and leaves one implementation-risk note: keep the parser scope narrow if odd markdown edge cases show up, and split those into follow-up work instead of bloating this task.

I did not start code changes or run tests in this step.

# djradon_2026-04-04_1424_40

proceed

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1424_48

I’m moving into implementation with TDD. I’ll add the failing writer/config/runtime tests first, then patch the writer and flag plumbing, then run focused slices before touching broader checks.

I’ve narrowed the implementation shape. The new flag can stay entirely in the existing writer-feature-flag path; the real code change is teaching the markdown writer to rewrite local inline destinations relative to the file it is writing, while preserving the current Dendron override for `.md` note links.

I’m at the point where the behavior is clear enough to code. The remaining work is mostly mechanical but it touches several contracts, so I’m adding the tests first to keep the default-true rollout from drifting across daemon/web/session-state paths.

I’m checking one cross-platform detail before editing: Linux-hosted tests still need to handle Windows-style absolute link targets correctly, so I’m verifying whether I need the std `windows` path submodule instead of the host-native path helpers.

I’m editing the tests now. The first pass is writer/rendering coverage plus config/session-state expectations, because those will force the default-true and Dendron-composition behavior into the code instead of leaving it implicit.

I hit a context mismatch patching the daemon-runtime tests, so I’m reading the exact blocks before editing them. This is just a line-drift issue, not a design blocker.

I’ve finished the red test pass. I’m running the targeted slices now to see the exact failures before I patch the writer and flag plumbing.

I’m switching from red to green now. The core implementation is: add the new workspace flag with default-true compatibility, then replace the writer’s single “style” pass with a combined link-render pass that can either emit `[[note]]` or a relative markdown destination depending on the target.

The type and default plumbing is in. I’m running the same focused test slice again now; the remaining failures should be real behavior mismatches in the writer, not contract-level missing fields.

The second run only failed because I used bare `deno test` and these suites need filesystem permission. I’m re-running the same focused slice with `-A` so we can see the actual behavior failures, not Deno permission noise.

The focused slices are green. I’m formatting the touched files and then running the broader `deno task check --frozen` pass the task note calls for, so we’re not stopping at unit coverage.

The code is green, including the repo-wide check pass. I’m doing the doc close-out now: update the task checkboxes you asked for, then add the contract note to `dev.codebase-overview` and `dev.decision-log` because this changed workspace writer behavior.

I’ve got the doc insertion points. I’m keeping them tight: one overview sentence about default relative sanitization plus Dendron composition, and one decision-log entry that freezes the rollout/default behavior so we don’t re-argue it later.

I’ve updated the task and the two dev notes. I’m formatting those markdown files now, then I’ll do one last targeted verification pass so the close-out reflects the final post-format state.

The implementation is complete and verified. I’m doing a final diff/status pass now so the summary reflects the actual touched files and I can call out one minor tool quirk: `deno fmt` didn’t accept the markdown-note paths directly, but `deno task check --frozen` still passed after the code/test changes.

Implemented.

The markdown writer now rewrites absolute local inline link and image destinations relative to the file being written, while preserving already-relative links as-authored and still letting local `.md` note links collapse to Dendron wikilinks when that flag is enabled. The new workspace flag `writerRelativizeLocalLinks` is wired through [markdown_writer.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/writer/markdown_writer.ts), [registry.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/runtime/src/workspace/registry.ts), [session_state.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/shared/src/contracts/session_state.ts), [daemon_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts), and [session_recording_actions.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/web/src/session_recording_actions.ts). New workspace scaffold output now includes `writerRelativizeLocalLinks: true` alongside `writerUseDendronStyleWikilinks: false`.

I added writer, config, persisted-state, daemon, CLI, and web integration coverage in [writer-markdown_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/writer-markdown_test.ts), [web-session-actions_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/web-session-actions_test.ts), [workspace-registry_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/workspace-registry_test.ts), [session-state-store_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/session-state-store_test.ts), [session-contracts_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/session-contracts_test.ts), [daemon-runtime_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts), and [daemon-cli_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/daemon-cli_test.ts). I also updated [[task.2026.2026-04-04-relative-link-output-sanitization]], [[dev.codebase-overview]], and [[dev.decision-log]]. The unrelated change in [[ka.conv.2026.2026-04-04_1358-kato-dendron-style-wikilinks-converter-codex]] was left untouched.

Verified with `deno test -A tests/writer-markdown_test.ts tests/workspace-registry_test.ts tests/session-contracts_test.ts tests/session-state-store_test.ts tests/web-session-actions_test.ts tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts tests/daemon-cli_test.ts` and `deno task check --frozen`.

codecov: " 2.57% of diff hit, target 80%"

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1444_06

I’m checking the current diff and the repository guidance first, then I’ll trace which changed paths are untested so we can close the Codecov gap instead of guessing.

The worktree is clean, so the Codecov complaint is almost certainly against committed branch diff, not uncommitted edits. I’m pulling the branch/base context and the coverage tooling next so we can target the actual uncovered lines.

The branch is already committed. I’m diffing it against `main` and then matching the changed production lines to their existing tests, because 2.57% means Codecov is likely seeing a lot of new executable lines that the focused slice didn’t exercise.

I have the changed executable surface. Most of the added branch weight is in `markdown_writer.ts`, so I’m running the repo’s actual coverage path and then a detailed report on just the changed runtime files.

The full coverage run is green locally, but that still doesn’t answer patch coverage. I’m mapping the added lines in the branch diff against `lcov.info` now; that will show whether Codecov is right and which exact hunks are missing.

The first pass shows the local `lcov.info` is not a reliable patch-coverage source by itself; the coverage artifact in `.test-tmp/coverage/root` only has a handful of hit lines for `markdown_writer.ts`, which contradicts the passing writer tests. I’m checking how the repo merges coverage slices before I trust or fix against the wrong artifact.

The mismatch is narrowed down: the `lcov.info` left behind by `deno test --coverage` is not the merged truth. The likely failure mode is that the last slice overwrites the report with env-only coverage. I’m regenerating `coverage.lcov` the same way CI does and checking the patch hit against that file.

I’ve reproduced the exact Codecov number from the branch’s normal `test:coverage` path, and a separate focused coverage run shows the changed lines are actually around 85% hit. That means this is now a coverage-pipeline bug, not just missing tests. I’m checking whether the culprit is the parallel-safe coverage mode, because that would be the smallest credible fix.

I’ve reproduced the problem: the branch’s actual changed lines are covered, but the repo’s two-slice coverage workflow collapses that to 2.6% when both slices write into the same coverage root. I’m verifying the CLI supports merging separate coverage directories before I patch the workflow.

I’ve got a concrete root cause and a narrow fix. I’m switching from investigation to patching the coverage workflow so each slice writes to its own profile directory, then the lcov task will merge those profiles instead of letting the env slice clobber the parallel-safe coverage map.

I’ve narrowed the code change to the test-slice runner and the lcov export task. Next I’m editing those pieces and adding a test that locks in the per-slice coverage directories so this doesn’t regress quietly.

I’m editing the runner and task wiring now. The substantive change is small: per-slice coverage directories plus a merged lcov export; everything else is just guardrails and documentation around that.

The patch is in. I’m running the command-builder test first, then the full repo coverage path again, because the only useful verification here is whether `coverage.lcov` now reflects the same patch coverage the focused run showed.

The workflow rerun is green. I’m doing one last check against the generated `coverage.lcov` itself, because that’s the artifact Codecov actually consumes and the only number that matters here is the merged patch hit.

The `2.57%` was a workflow bug, not a real test gap. The split coverage runner was sending both test slices into the same raw coverage directory, so the later env slice effectively stomped the earlier parallel-safe coverage map for files like [markdown_writer.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/writer/markdown_writer.ts). I changed [run-root-test-slices.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/scripts/run-root-test-slices.ts) so coverage mode writes to separate slice dirs under `.test-tmp/coverage/root/`, updated [deno.json](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/deno.json) so `coverage:lcov` merges both slice dirs, added a regression test in [run-root-test-slices_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/run-root-test-slices_test.ts), and synced [[dev.testing]].

Verified locally with `deno test tests/run-root-test-slices_test.ts`, `deno task test:coverage --frozen`, `deno task coverage:lcov`, and `deno task check --frozen`. The generated `coverage.lcov` now shows the changed implementation files at `335/394 = 85.0%` patch coverage, so a fresh Codecov run should clear the `80%` target.

commit msg

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1509_35

I’m checking the current staged/uncommitted delta so the commit message matches the actual coverage workflow fix rather than the earlier writer work.

```text
fix(testing): merge split coverage slices for Codecov

- write `test:parallel-safe` and `test:env` coverage output into separate
  `.test-tmp/coverage/root/*` directories instead of sharing one raw profile
- update `coverage:lcov` to merge both slice directories into the final
  `coverage.lcov` artifact consumed by CI and Codecov
- add a regression test for `buildCommands("coverage", ...)` so per-slice
  coverage directories do not silently collapse again
- refresh `dev.testing` to document the per-slice raw profiles and merged lcov
  workflow
- fix the patch-coverage underreporting where the later env slice was
  effectively clobbering earlier parallel-safe coverage
```

# djradon_2026-04-04_1958_56

anything left? we're done?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1959_06

I’m checking the worktree and the task note state so I can answer precisely whether anything material is still open versus just commit/CI follow-through.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1959_21

Implementation-wise, this is done. The checklist in [[task.2026.2026-04-04-relative-link-output-sanitization]] is fully checked off, and the local verification passed, including the Codecov workflow fix.

The only thing still sitting locally is an untracked conversation note: [[ka.conv.2026.2026-04-04_1525-kato-relative-link-output-sanitization-codex]]. If you normally keep those, fine. If not, that’s the only non-clean-tree item.

So from a product/code standpoint: done. From a process standpoint: just commit/push if you haven’t already, then let CI/Codecov rerun on the updated branch.

# djradon_2026-04-05_0831_36

I turned on wikilinks style, and noticed that a link to my README.md got rewritten even though it was outside the destination folder. I realize that Dendron multi-vault setups would ideally use wikilinks in any mounted dendron vault, but the simple check of "outside destination dir" might make better sense that parsing dendron.yml. Still, might be worth it... don't assume we're in dendron land, but have a look for a dendron.yml that includes the ouput dir, and keep track of all "wikilinkifiable directories"? What do you think?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0831_58

I’m checking the current Dendron-link rewrite logic and the local `dendron.yml` shape first, because the right answer depends on exactly what we’re matching today versus what directory context we actually have.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0832_09

The current writer does exactly the too-broad thing you described: it treats any local `.md` destination as wikilinkable, regardless of whether that target lives in the same note tree or any Dendron vault. I’m checking the workspace output root now so I can tell you whether a vault-aware heuristic would actually separate the README case cleanly here.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0832_20

There’s already a test proving the current behavior is broad enough to rewrite a sibling `README.md` note when Dendron mode is on. I’m reading that exact case and the core Dendron helper now, because that’s the line between “expected by current contract” and “worth tightening.”

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0833_14

I’ve got the key context. The current helper in [markdown_writer.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/writer/markdown_writer.ts) ignores filesystem scope entirely, and this repo’s [dendron.yml](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/dendron.yml) does give us enough local context to gate the rewrite more intelligently. I’m grabbing exact lines so the recommendation is concrete.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0833_52

The current behavior is too broad. Right now [resolveDendronWikilinkTarget()](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/writer/markdown_writer.ts#L514) only checks “local `.md` link” and then strips to basename, so it has no notion of vault scope, workspace scope, or whether the target is even part of a Dendron note tree.

I would not use “inside the destination directory” as the main rule. That’s safer than today, but it’s the wrong boundary for real Dendron use: sibling or parent notes in the same vault would stop wikilinkifying for no good reason.

I’d do this instead:

- Compute a `wikilinkifiableRoots` allowlist once upstream, not inside the low-level writer parser.
- If the output path lives under a nearby `dendron.yml`, parse that file and derive note roots from its mounted vaults.
  - In this repo, [dendron.yml](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/dendron.yml#L23) declares a self-contained vault, so the practical note root is `dev-docs/notes/`, not every markdown file in the repo.
- Only rewrite `.md` links whose resolved target path falls inside one of those roots.
- If no matching `dendron.yml` is found, fall back to a narrow non-Dendron heuristic, ideally the workspace root / output note tree, not just the destination file’s folder.
- Do not try full x-vault link semantics yet. This repo has `enableXVaultWikiLink: false` in [dendron.yml](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/dendron.yml#L64), so using vault discovery purely as an eligibility gate is enough for now.

For your current setup, with [`.kato-workspace-config.yaml`](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/.kato-workspace-config.yaml#L2) writing into `dev-docs/notes/` and `writerUseDendronStyleWikilinks: true`, that would leave a repo-root `README.md` alone while still converting actual vault notes.

So yes: worth doing, but as a vault-aware/root-allowlist check, not a simple “outside destination dir” rule. If you want, I can patch it that way next.

# djradon_2026-04-05_0837_20

FYI, all Dendron notes are in the same folder, so "sibling or parent notes" doesn't really apply in the way I think you mean.

Here's a snippet of a dendron.yml from a different vscode workspace:

workspace:
    vaults:
        - fsPath: dependencies/github.com/spectacular-voyage/accord/documentation
          remote:
              type: git
              url: git@github.com:spectacular-voyage/accord.git
          name: accord
          selfContained: true
        - fsPath: dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework
          remote:
              type: git
              url: git@github.com:semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework.git
          name: semantic-flow-framework
          selfContained: true

Obviously, fsPath is what you need to check. Finding [dendron.yml](dev-docs/dendron.yml) is usually in the parent folder, but might even be higher. Are you think the wikilinkifiableRoots is kept in workspace config? Or calculated once per daemon load?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0838_18

Not in workspace config. I’d treat `wikilinkifiableRoots` as derived runtime state.

`workspaceFeatureFlags.writerUseDendronStyleWikilinks` is user intent. The actual roots should be computed from disk and cached, because they depend on where the output lives and what `dendron.yml` says at that moment. “Once per daemon load” is too coarse: workspace config reloads live, web actions use the same pipeline, and `dendron.yml` can change without a daemon restart.

One pushback: `fsPath` alone is still too broad. In this repo, [dendron.yml](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/dendron.yml#L23) points at `dev-docs`, but the actual notes are under `dev-docs/notes/`. If we allow all markdown under `fsPath`, we still wrongly wikilinkify non-note files like `README.md`.

I’d implement it like this:

- Find the nearest ancestor `dendron.yml` above the output path, climbing upward until root.
- Parse `workspace.vaults[].fsPath` and resolve each one relative to the directory containing `dendron.yml`.
- Derive note roots from those vaults.
  - For the self-contained shape you’re using here, that should usually be `vaultRoot/notes` when that directory exists.
  - Only fall back to `vaultRoot` if there is no `notes/` subtree.
- Keep those resolved note roots in an in-memory cache keyed by `dendron.yml` path + mtime.
- Thread the derived roots into the render context.
- Only convert `.md` links to wikilinks when the resolved target path is inside one of those roots.
- Otherwise leave the link in normal markdown form and let the relative-link sanitizer do its job.

So: calculated once per resolved workspace/profile load, with caching and invalidation. Not persisted in workspace config.

# djradon_2026-04-05_0841_05

Please fill out @task.2026.2026-04-05-dendron-vault-awareness.md with your task proposal. 

Yes, I believe the variant is "if selfContained==true, expect the vault to be at fsPath + "/notes". Otherwise just as fsPath.

It'd be nice if the UI would show wikilinkifiableRoots in the web workspace page.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0841_17

I’m reading the new task note and the adjacent Dendron-link notes first, then I’ll patch the proposal so it captures the `selfContained` rule and the workspace-page visibility request without overcommitting implementation detail.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0842_28

I have the proposal shape. I’m checking the existing workspaces loader quickly so the task note names the right UI seam instead of waving at “the web page” generically.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0842_45

I’ve got the proposal scoped. I’m patching the task note now with the vault-root discovery rule, runtime caching stance, and the read-only web workspace visibility you asked for.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0843_39

The first patch missed the exact blank section shape. I’m reopening the note with line numbers and then I’ll replace it in one clean pass.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0844_56

Updated [[ka.completed.2026.2026-04-05-dendron-vault-awareness]].

The proposal now captures:
- runtime-derived `wikilinkifiableRoots`, not workspace-config state
- ancestor `dendron.yml` discovery from the final `outputPath`
- the rule you wanted: `selfContained: true` => `fsPath/notes`, otherwise `fsPath`
- fail-closed Dendron rewriting outside those roots
- read-only web workspace diagnostics for matched `dendron.yml` and roots

I did not run tests since this was a task-note edit only.

# djradon_2026-04-05_0848_10

Instead of "If no matching Dendron context is found, Kato should leave standard markdown
links alone even when the Dendron writer flag is enabled." -- I think we just target the output directory... If the workspace output folder is the folder that contains a linked .md, rewrite it.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0848_21

I’m checking that sentence in the task note against the rest of the proposal before I change it, because “same output directory” is a materially different contract than the vault-aware approach above it.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0848_33

The pure same-directory rule is weaker than the vault-aware contract above it, but as a fallback it makes sense. I’m patching the note to say: use Dendron roots when found, otherwise fall back to the output file’s directory as the minimal wikilinkable scope.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0849_05

Updated the note in [[ka.completed.2026.2026-04-05-dendron-vault-awareness]].

It now says:
- use Dendron-derived `wikilinkifiableRoots` when a matching `dendron.yml` is found
- otherwise fall back to the rendered output file’s own directory as the only wikilinkable scope
- same-directory `.md` links can rewrite, but parent/sibling-directory markdown links stay standard

That fits your “target the output directory” rule without throwing away the vault-aware path when a real Dendron workspace is present.

No tests run; this was a task-note edit only.

# djradon_2026-04-05_0853_18

OK, ready to implement? New chat or this one?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0853_29

Ready.

A new chat is slightly better here because this is a distinct follow-up task with a changed contract, and it keeps the implementation trail cleaner against [[ka.completed.2026.2026-04-05-dendron-vault-awareness]].

But this chat is also fine. I already have the relevant context, so if you want to keep momentum, stay here and I’ll start implementing.

# djradon_2026-04-05_0858_47

OK, start implementing

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0859_04

I’m implementing the vault-aware Dendron rewrite now. First I’m mapping the existing writer path, runtime/web render plumbing, and workspace-page loader so I can add the eligibility boundary once instead of scattering heuristics.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0859_24

I’ve confirmed the current worktree only has the task/conv notes untracked, so the implementation surface is clean. Next I’m drilling into the workspaces page rendering and the writer test helpers so I can add the Dendron diagnostics and the rewrite boundary without inventing a new seam.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0859_35

I’ve identified the likely UI seam: [loadWorkspacesPageData()](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/web/src/loaders/workspaces.ts) already augments workspace rows, so that’s the right place to attach read-only Dendron diagnostics instead of bending the writer to serve UI state. I’m reading the shared workspace summary types and the live island next so the new fields land cleanly.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0900_25

Implementing the vault-aware wikilendering change now. I’m rereading the repo guidance and then wiring Dendron root discovery through the writer and workspace UI so we can tighten the rewrite scope without breaking the relative-link work.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0900_34

I’ve confirmed the seam: the current Dendron rewrite is basename-only and has no filesystem scope, so the fix needs a real eligibility context, not another ad hoc check. Next I’m reading the runtime workspace/status types and the existing writer/web tests so I can land the behavior and the diagnostics together.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0900_45

The writer tests already cover the broad rewrite, and the web loader already has a natural place to surface diagnostics. I’m checking the existing YAML/path utilities now so the vault discovery lands in the runtime layer once and both daemon and web can reuse it.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0901_13

I’ve got the shape now: this wants a reusable runtime helper that finds the applicable `dendron.yml`, derives vault note roots, and hands those roots to both the writer and the workspace page. I’m checking the current route/loader tests before I edit so I can add the negative case you hit with `README.md` and a UI assertion for the derived roots.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0901_32

The key tradeoff is where to compute the roots. I’m keeping the actual filesystem discovery outside the pure markdown renderer so `renderEventsToMarkdown()` stays sync and testable, then I’ll have the async writer path compute and inject the real roots based on the concrete output path.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0901_46

The path-policy part definitely needs tests. For the UI side I may keep the assertion at the loader/data layer unless there’s already a cheap page render harness nearby; if there is, I’ll use it, but I’m not going to overbuild frontend test scaffolding for a couple of diagnostic lines.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0901_57

I’m double-checking the task note wording before I lock the lookup rules in code. The main ambiguity is whether to stop at the first `dendron.yml` found or keep climbing until one of them actually covers the output path; the latter is safer if there’s a stray config nested inside a bigger repo.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0902_07

The task note is clear enough: keep climbing until a `dendron.yml` actually covers the output path, then use all of that config’s derived note roots. I’m moving to tests first so the implementation can’t regress back to the basename-only behavior.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0902_23

One more wrinkle showed up: `defaultOutputDir` can be a template, so the workspace page can’t always know a single concrete future output folder. I’m checking how the existing profile resolver treats that today; if it stays dynamic, the page should probably diagnose against the current resolved default output dir only when it’s stable, not pretend tokenized paths are concrete.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0904_51

The renderer has more Dendron-focused unit tests than just the obvious one, so I’m auditing all of them before I patch the implementation. Otherwise this change will look fine in the main path and quietly break the secondary surfaces like decision summaries and provider info sections.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0905_18

I’m at the edit point now. First patch is the shared runtime helper plus exports, so the writer and the web loader can both consume the same Dendron-root discovery logic instead of each inventing their own boundary rules.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0906_20

I’m editing the writer now. The change is to stop deciding “wikilink or not” from the raw destination string alone and instead resolve the target against the actual output file plus the derived root allowlist.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0908_02

I’m adding the shared discovery tests first. They pin down the lookup contract: climb ancestors, skip nonmatching configs, derive `fsPath` roots correctly, and fall back to the output directory only when nothing matches.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0908_51

I’m tightening the writer tests now. The important new cases are the one you hit in practice: a real note inside the allowed roots should collapse to `[[note]]`, but `README.md` outside those roots must stay a normal markdown link and just be relativized if that feature is on.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0909_26

The integration test is moving from synthetic `/workspace/...` paths to a real temp workspace with a real `dendron.yml`. That matters because the bug only reproduces when the writer has an actual filesystem context to inspect.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0909_58

I’ve moved past the writer and into the web loader. The goal there is deliberately read-only: derive the same root context the writer would use for a default note output and expose it so the workspace page can tell you why a given link would or wouldn’t become a wikilink.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0910_32

I’ve got the UI wired; now I’m pinning it with a loader test that proves the page model sees the same multi-root Dendron context the writer would. That keeps the diagnostics honest instead of just reflecting whatever we hoped the config meant.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0911_01

I found one subtle mismatch in the unit tests: a few old paths were “repo-root relative,” not actually relative to the rendered file. I’m correcting those so the new resolution rule is testing real markdown semantics instead of the old loose behavior.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0911_25

The code and test changes are in place. I’m running the focused runtime/writer/web suites now to catch the inevitable path-handling mistakes before I touch docs or the task checklist.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0911_34

The first test run only told me I forgot the usual Deno permissions. The path-sensitive unit cases already look healthy; I’m rerunning with `-A` now so the file-backed tests can actually execute.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0911_49

The focused suites are clean. I’m formatting the touched files and then running the broader typecheck so we don’t end up with a green unit run but a broken web/runtime compile.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0912_19

The code is done and checked. I’m updating the task note and the two standing dev notes now so the runtime contract change is documented where the team actually looks for it later.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0912_28

I’m closing the loop in docs now. The main doc change is to correct the earlier broad Dendron statement: it’s no longer “any local `.md` can collapse,” it’s “only note targets inside the derived vault roots, otherwise same-directory fallback.”

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0913_10

The code path is stable now. I’m doing one last status pass so I can tell you exactly what changed and whether anything is still untracked before we call this done.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0913_39

Implemented vault-aware Dendron wikilinking. [markdown_writer.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/writer/markdown_writer.ts) no longer rewrites any local `.md` link blindly; it now resolves targets against the final output file and only collapses links that land inside derived `wikilinkifiableRoots`. The shared discovery logic lives in [dendron.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/runtime/src/workspace/dendron.ts): walk upward from `outputPath`, parse ancestor `dendron.yml` files, derive roots from `workspace.vaults[].fsPath` with `selfContained: true -> fsPath/notes`, and fall back to `dirname(outputPath)` when no config matches. Links like `README.md` outside those roots stay standard markdown and still get relativized when that flag is on.

I also surfaced the diagnostics on the workspace page via [workspaces.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/web/src/loaders/workspaces.ts) and [WorkspacesLive.tsx](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/web/islands/WorkspacesLive.tsx), and added coverage in [workspace-dendron_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/workspace-dendron_test.ts), [writer-markdown_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/writer-markdown_test.ts), [web-session-actions_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/web-session-actions_test.ts), and [web-activity-loader_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/web-activity-loader_test.ts). Docs are updated in [[dev.codebase-overview]], [[dev.decision-log]], and [[ka.completed.2026.2026-04-05-dendron-vault-awareness]].

Verified with `deno test -A tests/workspace-dendron_test.ts tests/writer-markdown_test.ts tests/web-session-actions_test.ts tests/web-activity-loader_test.ts` and `deno task check --frozen`.

fix(writer): scope Dendron wikilinks to discovered vault note roots

- add runtime Dendron context discovery from the final markdown output path
  by walking ancestor dendron.yml files and caching derived note roots by mtime
- derive wikilinkifiable roots from workspace.vaults[].fsPath using
  selfContained => fsPath/notes and fail closed for missing self-contained
  note dirs instead of guessing
- rewrite markdown .md links to Dendron wikilinks only when the resolved
  target path falls inside the derived roots, with same-directory fallback when
  no matching Dendron workspace is found
- preserve normal markdown links for .md targets outside the derived roots,
  including repo files like README.md, while still allowing relative-link
  sanitization to run
- surface matched dendron.yml and wikilinkifiableRoots as read-only
  diagnostics on the web Workspaces page
- add runtime discovery, writer, web action, and workspace loader coverage for
  vault-aware eligibility and fallback behavior
- update the Dendron vault-awareness task note, codebase overview, and
  decision log to reflect the narrowed writer contract
```

# djradon_2026-04-05_0916_42

Could you compose @release-notes.0.2.11.md with all changes since the last version?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0916_58

I’m pulling the release note format, the current target note, and the git/version history first. Then I’ll draft the `0.2.11` note from the actual changes since the prior release rather than summarizing from memory.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0917_11

I have the release range now: `v0.2.10..HEAD`, which includes the Dendron/writer work plus a few CI and docs updates. I’m reading the recent release-note style next so the `0.2.11` note matches the existing shape instead of inventing a new format.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0917_29

The release is clearly centered on workspace markdown output behavior, with a smaller testing/release-process tail. I’m checking the manual-release workflow and the bumped version files just long enough to avoid overstating that part in the notes.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0917_56

I have enough to draft this cleanly: one core product theme, one upgrade section, and one developer-oriented tail for coverage/release/CI. I’m writing the note into the versioned release-notes file now.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0918_18

Composed [[release-notes.v0.2.11]] from the `v0.2.10..HEAD` change range.

It covers the workspace markdown changes, Dendron vault-awareness follow-up, the Codecov coverage fix, and the release/CI workflow updates. I did not run tests for this step since it was a release-note edit only.

# djradon_2026-04-05_0922_06

error: Found 2 not formatted files in 63 files

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0922_24

Most likely: CI and local are running different `deno fmt` versions.

Those diffs are classic formatter-version drift, not logic drift. The changes are just line wrapping and argument/list layout. If the checked-out commit is the same and CI is literally running:

```bash
deno fmt --check deno.json src tests
```

then the usual causes are:

- CI has a different Deno version than your machine
- your editor formatted with something other than the repo’s Deno version
- you didn’t actually run the exact same `fmt:check` command locally against the same files
- local uncommitted changes differ from what got pushed

The first one is by far the most likely here.

What to check:

1. Compare `deno --version` locally vs in GitHub Actions.
2. Make sure the workflow pins Deno, instead of floating.
3. Run locally with the CI version exactly:
   ```bash
   deno fmt --check deno.json src tests
   ```
4. If needed, reformat with that same version:
   ```bash
   deno fmt deno.json src tests
   ```

If you want, paste the workflow’s Deno setup step and your local `deno --version`, and I can tell you if that’s the mismatch.

# djradon_2026-04-05_0923_30

deno fmt --check deno.json src tests  doesn't report anything, except "checked 93 files". We are on deno 2.7.11 locally. Are we specifying deno version in our github action?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0923_41

I’m checking the workflow files directly. The failure pattern still looks like formatter-version drift, so I want to see whether CI pins Deno or is floating on whatever `setup-deno` resolves that day.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0924_01

Yes, in this repo we do specify Deno in GitHub Actions, but only loosely.

CI uses `denoland/setup-deno@v2` with `deno-version: v2.x` in [ci.yml:20](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L20), and the release workflow does the same in [release-manual.yml:61](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/.github/workflows/release-manual.yml#L61), [release-manual.yml:188](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/.github/workflows/release-manual.yml#L188), [release-manual.yml:264](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/.github/workflows/release-manual.yml#L264), and [release-manual.yml:313](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/.github/workflows/release-manual.yml#L313).

So the answer is: yes, but it is not pinned. `v2.x` floats to whatever the latest Deno 2 release is on the runner. That absolutely can explain `deno fmt --check` passing locally on `2.7.11` and failing in GitHub with pure wrapping/layout diffs.

If you want deterministic formatting, pin it to the exact local version, for example:

```yaml
with:
  deno-version: 2.7.11
```

If you want, I can patch the workflows to pin Deno instead of floating on `v2.x`.

# djradon_2026-04-05_0945_26

It's okay. 

Here's some coderabbit comments. Please evaluate whether they're worth doing, and implement the ones that are.

Verify each finding against the current code and only fix it if needed.

Inline comments:
In `@apps/daemon/src/writer/markdown_writer.ts`:
- Around line 59-60: The current change collapses the resolver fallback mode
into wikilinkifiableRoots and then uses isPathWithinRoots(), causing
same-directory-only fallback (output-directory-fallback) to behave as
descendant-inclusive; update the rendering options/context to carry the resolver
mode (e.g., a field like resolverMode or mode) alongside renderOutputPath and
wikilinkifiableRoots, and modify the logic that decides whether a target is
allowed so that when resolverMode === 'output-directory-fallback' you perform an
exact same-directory check against dirname(renderOutputPath) (not
isPathWithinRoots), while preserving the descendant-inclusive
isPathWithinRoots() behavior for the other modes; update all uses around
wikilinkifiableRoots, isPathWithinRoots, and renderOutputPath to consult the new
mode field (references: wikilinkifiableRoots, isPathWithinRoots(),
renderOutputPath, output-directory-fallback).
- Around line 1209-1214: The Dendron discovery call
resolveDendronWikilinkContext(renderOutputPath) must not abort writes; wrap that
call in a try/catch inside the code path used by appendEvents and
overwriteEvents (where the snippet lives), and on error set a safe fallback for
wikilinkifiableRoots (e.g., options.fallbackRoots || [] or an empty array) and
optionally log a warning instead of rethrowing; then return the merged options
object using that fallback (keep the same return shape with renderOutputPath and
wikilinkifiableRoots) so appendEvents/overwriteEvents proceed even when
resolveDendronWikilinkContext fails.

In `@apps/runtime/src/workspace/dendron.ts`:
- Around line 37-47: Change readMtimeMs to readConfigStat and make it return a
FileInfo-like value (e.g., { exists: boolean, mtimeMs?: number | null } or a
distinct FileInfo type) or undefined only when the file truly does not exist;
specifically, when Deno.stat(path) succeeds but stat.mtime is null, return an
object indicating the file exists with mtimeMs set to null rather than returning
undefined. Then update the cache handling that currently uses sourceMtimeMs (the
variables used around the previous lines 64–68, 71–73, and 125–129) to
explicitly distinguish three cases: file missing (readConfigStat returned
undefined), file exists with a numeric mtime (mtimeMs is a number), and file
exists but mtime unavailable (mtimeMs === null or undefined): treat the “mtime
unavailable” case as the config existing (do not fall back to
output-directory-fallback) and force a conservative cache invalidation/update
path rather than treating it as missing. Ensure references to readMtimeMs are
replaced with readConfigStat across the file and adjust any type
annotations/usages accordingly.

In `@apps/web/src/loaders/workspaces.ts`:
- Around line 133-141: The probe is using the raw defaultOutputDirTemplate when
calling resolveDendronWikilinkContext, which fails for templated output dirs;
after loadWorkspaceConfigOverrides returns, resolve/expand the
defaultOutputDirTemplate using the same template-expansion logic used by the
recording path generator (i.e., produce a concrete path relative to
row.workspaceRoot or return undefined if it cannot be resolved), then set
resolvedDefaultOutputDir to that expanded value (falling back to
DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_OUTPUT_DIR_RELATIVE only after expansion fails) and only call
resolveDendronWikilinkContext(join(resolvedDefaultOutputDir,
"__kato-wikilink-probe__.md")) when a concrete path exists; otherwise omit
probing/diagnostics for that workspace.

Nitpick comments:
In `@dev-docs/notes/dev.codebase-overview.md`:
- Line 5: The frontmatter contains a manually set updated field ("updated:
1772775700000"); remove or revert this manual updated field so Dendron can
manage it automatically — locate the note's frontmatter (the "updated" key) and
delete that line (or restore the original frontmatter without the updated
timestamp) and save the note so the Dendron extension will populate the
timestamp on next edit.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0945_40

I’m verifying each comment against the current implementation first. Then I’ll patch only the ones that are real issues and rerun the targeted tests for the affected writer/runtime/web paths.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0945_50

I’ve verified the three substantive comments against current code. Two look real in this codebase: the fallback mode is indeed too broad, and the mtime handling can treat an existing config with missing `mtime` as absent. The “don’t abort writes on Dendron discovery failure” point is also worth hardening. The templated-output-dir comment for the workspace page is real as well; the current probe resolves the template string literally.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0946_46

The web-loader comment is the only one that needs design judgment, not just a bug fix. It’s correct that the current probe treats template strings literally, but the workspace page also has no real provider/session context. I’m going to use the same path-expansion code with stable placeholder values so the probe path is concrete without inventing new product behavior.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0946_51

I’ve got enough context to patch cleanly. I’m changing the writer contract first so fallback mode is represented explicitly, then I’ll harden discovery/error handling and update the workspace loader probe to use expanded placeholder paths instead of literal templates.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0947_55

I’m editing the writer tests alongside the logic change so the fallback bug is locked down. The new case is a nested child note under the same folder fallback: that should stay markdown, not collapse to a wikilink.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0948_20

The writer contract is patched. Next is the runtime Dendron resolver: I’m changing the file-stat handling so “config exists but `mtime` is unavailable” no longer gets misclassified as “config missing,” which could silently drop a valid Dendron workspace.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0948_51

The workspace-page probe is the only place I’m intentionally using placeholder render inputs. That keeps the diagnostic path concrete enough to find a matching `dendron.yml` without pretending we know a real future provider/session tuple on the Workspaces screen.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0949_12

I’m updating the targeted tests now: one for the exact same-directory fallback, one for non-fatal discovery errors, and one for templated workspace output dirs on the Workspaces page.

The code changes are in. I’m formatting and running the writer/runtime/web suites that cover exactly the touched paths, then I’ll tell you which CodeRabbit findings were real and which ones turned out not to need extra work beyond the fix set.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0950_06

The targeted fixes are clean. I’m doing one last status pass now so I can tell you exactly which CodeRabbit comments were worth acting on and note the unrelated local change I left alone.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0950_33

I verified all five comments against the current code. All five were worth addressing.

Applied:
- [markdown_writer.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/writer/markdown_writer.ts): added explicit `wikilinkContextMode` handling so `output-directory-fallback` is now exact same-directory only, not descendant-inclusive; also made writer-side Dendron discovery non-fatal so writes continue with wikilinks disabled if discovery blows up.
- [dendron.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/runtime/src/workspace/dendron.ts): fixed config-stat handling so an existing `dendron.yml` with missing `mtime` is no longer treated as missing; cache reuse now only short-circuits on numeric mtimes.
- [workspaces.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/web/src/loaders/workspaces.ts): changed the workspace-page probe to expand `defaultOutputDir` with the same template logic used for real output paths, using stable placeholder values, instead of resolving raw template strings literally.
- [[dev.codebase-overview]]: removed the manual `updated` frontmatter field.
- Added regression coverage in [writer-markdown_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/writer-markdown_test.ts) and [web-activity-loader_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/web-activity-loader_test.ts).

Verified with:
- `deno test -A tests/workspace-dendron_test.ts tests/writer-markdown_test.ts tests/web-activity-loader_test.ts tests/web-session-actions_test.ts`
- `deno task check --frozen`

I left the unrelated local change in [[ka.conv.2026.2026-04-04_1525-kato-relative-link-output-sanitization-codex]] untouched.

fix(writer): harden Dendron fallback and diagnostics handling

- make markdown writer carry explicit Dendron wikilink context mode so
  output-directory fallback only rewrites same-directory .md links instead of
  treating descendants as implicitly eligible
- keep append/overwrite writes non-fatal when Dendron context discovery fails
  by falling back to empty wikilink roots instead of aborting the render
- treat existing dendron.yml files with unavailable mtime as present in runtime
  discovery/cache logic instead of misclassifying them as missing
- expand workspace-page Dendron diagnostics through the real defaultOutputDir
  template resolver using stable placeholder values instead of probing raw
  template strings literally
- add regression coverage for same-directory fallback, non-fatal discovery
  failure, and templated workspace-output diagnostics
- remove the manually managed updated timestamp from dev.codebase-overview
  frontmatter so Dendron can own it again
