# Per-Workspace Daemon Instances

## Goal

Support workspace-local Kato setups by letting each workspace have its own
runtime config and its own generated recording defaults.

The main UX target is:

1. run `kato init` for a workspace-local setup
2. get a config seeded from a reusable personal template, if present
3. use `::init`, `::record`, and `::capture` with either relative paths or no
   path at all
4. use `::export` with either a file path, a directory path, or no path
5. have generated destinations land in the workspace’s preferred location and
   naming scheme

## What We Already Have

- Runtime config already carries recording-adjacent settings, including
  `markdownFrontmatter.includeConversationEventKinds`.
- Generated default destinations are still hard-coded in
  `/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts`:
  - root dir: `~/.kato/recordings`
  - filename shape: `<provider>-<shortSessionId>-<timestamp>.md`
- `kato init` currently writes only the built-in default config shape.
- In-chat explicit path arguments are still absolute-only today.

## Approach

Add the minimum config surface needed to make workspace-local setups practical:

- add config-driven generated output defaults
- allow relative explicit command paths
- add a reusable global config template that seeds new workspace configs during
  `kato init`
- reuse the same filename generator for pathless `export`
- if an output argument points at a directory, treat it as an output root and
  generate the filename inside that directory

## Proposed Config Additions

Add two optional runtime-config fields:

- `defaultOutputDir?: string`
- `filenameTemplate?: string`

Recommended semantics:

- `defaultOutputDir` is the base directory used when Kato needs to generate a
  destination for a pathless command.
- `filenameTemplate` is the filename pattern used under that directory.
- If either field is omitted, Kato falls back to the current behavior so older
  configs remain valid.

Recommended default values:

- `defaultOutputDir: .kato/recordings`
- `filenameTemplate: "conv.{YYYY}-{MM}-{DD}_{HH}{mm}-{snippetSlug}-{provider}.md"`

## Config Template For New Workspaces

Add support for a reusable config template in `~/.kato/` that is consulted only
when creating a new workspace-local config with `kato init`.

Template filename:

- `~/.kato/kato-config.template.yaml`

Recommended behavior:

- If a global config template file exists, `kato init` uses it as the starting
  shape for new per-workspace configs.
- If no template exists, `kato init` uses the normal built-in defaults.
- The template is a scaffold source only. It is not merged at runtime after the
  workspace config has been created.
- This lets users reuse personal defaults like:
  - `filenameTemplate`
  - `markdownFrontmatter.includeConversationEventKinds`
  - preferred `providerSessionRoots`
  - feature-flag defaults

Important path rule:

- Relative paths in the template should be copied into the new workspace config
  as relative values, not resolved against `~/.kato/` at scaffold time.
- That way a template value like `defaultOutputDir: documentation/notes` remains
  portable and resolves relative to each workspace config after initialization.

## Filename Template Contract

Keep templating intentionally small.

Initial token set:

- `{provider}`: sanitized provider name
- `{sessionId}`: full session id
- `{shortSessionId}`: first 8 chars of session id
- `{snippetSlug}`: slugified conversation snippet/title
- `{YYYY}`: UTC+0 year
- `{MM}`: UTC+0 month (`01`-`12`)
- `{DD}`: UTC+0 day (`01`-`31`)
- `{HH}`: UTC+0 hour (`00`-`23`)
- `{mm}`: UTC+0 minute (`00`-`59`)
- `{ss}`: UTC+0 second (`00`-`59`)

Rules:

- Template expansion produces a filename only, not a full path.
- The template must not be allowed to escape directories (`/`, `..`, or path
  separators introduced by token values).
- If the rendered filename is empty or invalid, fail closed and log clearly.
- Timestamp tokens use UTC+0 time, not local time.
- `snippetSlug` should be derived from the same snippet/title source already
  used for recording titles, then slugified and sanitized.
- Keep `.md` in the default template for now; this task does not introduce
  format-aware filename generation.

## Path Resolution Rules

- Generated paths should resolve as:
  `join(resolvedDefaultOutputDir, renderedFilename)`.
- If `defaultOutputDir` is absolute, use it directly.
- If `defaultOutputDir` is relative, resolve it against the workspace root. In
  the default layout, that is the parent of `katoDir` / `.kato/`.
- Explicit relative command arguments should also resolve against that same
  workspace root, not against daemon cwd.
- Explicit absolute command arguments remain valid.
- If an explicit output argument resolves to a directory, use that directory as
  the base dir and still generate the filename from `filenameTemplate`.
- This directory-argument behavior should apply to `::init`, `::capture`, and
  `::export` when a path argument is present but names a directory.
- The same directory-argument behavior should apply to CLI
  `kato export <session> --output <dir>`.
- Directory detection rule:
  - [ ] an existing directory always counts as a directory
  - [ ] a non-existent path counts as a directory only if the raw argument ends
        with a path separator
  - [ ] otherwise, treat it as a file path
- The final generated path still goes through the existing write-path policy
  gate.
- `allowedWriteRoots` remains the hard security boundary.

## Scope

- [x] Add `defaultOutputDir` and `filenameTemplate` to the runtime config
      contract.
- [x] Add a global config-template file that `kato init` can use to seed new
      workspace configs.
- [x] Parse, validate, clone, and serialize those fields in the runtime config
      store.
- [x] Allow relative explicit command paths by resolving them against the
      workspace config root.
- [x] Include the new fields in configs generated by `kato init`.
- [x] Replace hard-coded default destination generation for pathless `::init`,
      `::record`, `::capture`, and `::export`.
- [x] Support directory-path arguments by using them as the output root and
      still generating the filename.
- [x] Apply the same directory-path rule to CLI `kato export --output <dir>`.
- [x] Update docs to show how a workspace-local daemon can customize default
      recording output.
- [ ] modify the kato init command to, at least by default, add everything in
      the .kato folder to .gitignore EXCEPT the config file

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Extend shared config contract

- [x] Update
      [/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/shared/src/contracts/config.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/shared/src/contracts/config.ts)
      to add:
  - [x] `defaultOutputDir?: string`
  - [x] `filenameTemplate?: string`

### 2. Extend runtime config parsing/defaults

- [x] Update
      [/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/config/runtime_config.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/config/runtime_config.ts)
      to:
  - [x] validate both fields as strings when present
  - [x] expand `~` for `defaultOutputDir` during load
  - [x] resolve/normalize relative `defaultOutputDir` against the workspace root
  - [ ] preserve home shorthand when generating default config (same style as
        existing path fields)
  - [x] clone both fields correctly
  - [x] emit default values from `createDefaultRuntimeConfig(...)`
  - [x] keep relative values portable when copied from the global config
        template into a new workspace config

### 3. Add global config-template support for `kato init`

- [x] Add a template lookup in `~/.kato/` for new workspace initialization.
- [x] Use `~/.kato/kato-config.template.yaml` as the template path.
- [x] Parse and validate the template before using it.
- [x] Treat the template as a partial scaffold source, not a runtime overlay.
- [x] Define merge order for new workspace config creation as:
  - [x] built-in defaults
  - [x] global config template values, if present
  - [x] workspace-specific path values written by the init flow
- [x] Fail closed if the template is invalid, with a clear init error.

### 4. Replace hard-coded default destination generation

- [x] Refactor
      [/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts):
  - [x] replace `resolveDefaultRecordingRootDir()`
  - [x] replace `makeDefaultRecordingDestinationPath(...)`
  - [x] introduce a config-aware helper that builds the generated destination
        from `defaultOutputDir` + `filenameTemplate`
  - [x] use that helper anywhere pathless `::init`, `::record`, `::capture`, or
        `::export` currently falls back to a generated path
  - [x] generate timestamp pieces from UTC+0
  - [x] generate `snippetSlug` from the current conversation snippet/title
  - [x] add support for overriding only the base directory when the explicit
        argument resolves to a directory

### 5. Support relative explicit command paths

- [x] Update command argument resolution in
      [/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts)
      so explicit relative arguments are accepted.
- [x] Resolve explicit relative arguments against the workspace root.
- [x] Keep existing normalization for markdown-link and quoted path arguments.
- [x] Distinguish file-path arguments from directory-path arguments after
      normalization/resolution.
- [x] Continue rejecting invalid or escaping paths after normalization.

### 6. Surface new defaults in `kato init`

- [x] Ensure the generated config written by `kato init` includes
      `defaultOutputDir` and `filenameTemplate`.
- [x] If the global config template exists, use it to seed the new workspace
      config before writing the file.

### 7. Tests

- [x] Update
      [/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/runtime-config_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/runtime-config_test.ts):
  - [x] accept valid values
  - [x] reject invalid types
  - [x] preserve backward compatibility when fields are missing
  - [x] verify relative `defaultOutputDir` resolves against workspace root
  - [x] verify `filenameTemplate` loads and clones correctly
- [x] Update
      [/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/daemon-cli_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/daemon-cli_test.ts)
      to verify:
  - [ ] `kato init` writes the new defaults
  - [ ] `kato init` uses the global config template when present
  - [ ] invalid global config template fails init clearly
  - [x] `kato export <id> --output <dir>` uses that directory plus generated
        filename
- [x] Update
      [/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts):
  - [ ] bare `::init` uses config-driven default path
  - [ ] bare `::record` uses config-driven default path
  - [ ] bare `::capture` uses config-driven default path
  - [x] bare `::export` uses config-driven default path
  - [x] explicit relative `::init` path resolves against workspace root
  - [x] explicit relative `::capture` path resolves against workspace root
  - [x] explicit relative `::export` path resolves against workspace root
  - [ ] explicit directory-path `::init` uses that directory plus generated
        filename
  - [ ] explicit directory-path `::capture` uses that directory plus generated
        filename
  - [ ] explicit directory-path `::export` uses that directory plus generated
        filename
  - [ ] non-existent path with trailing separator is treated as a directory
  - [ ] non-existent path without trailing separator is treated as a file path
  - [x] filename template rendering uses expected tokens, including
        `snippetSlug`
  - [x] UTC+0 date-part tokens render correctly
  - [ ] final generated path is still denied when outside `allowedWriteRoots`

### 8. Docs

- [x] Update
      [/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/README.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/README.md)
      runtime-config docs and examples.
- [x] Add one example of a workspace-local config that writes into a project
      notes directory.
- [x] Add one example of a reusable global config template for new workspaces.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] A runtime config can define `defaultOutputDir` and `filenameTemplate`.
- [x] Pathless `::init`, `::record`, and `::capture` use those defaults instead
      of the current hard-coded `~/.kato/recordings/...` path.
- [x] Pathless `::export` uses the same generator and `defaultOutputDir`.
- [x] Explicit relative command paths are accepted and resolve against the
      workspace root.
- [x] If an explicit output argument resolves to a directory, that directory is
      used as the output root and the filename is still generated.
- [x] CLI `kato export <id> --output <dir>` uses that directory as the output
      root and still generates the filename.
- [x] Existing directories are treated as directory arguments, and non-existent
      paths are treated as directory arguments only when the raw input ends with
      a path separator.
- [x] Relative `defaultOutputDir` is resolved against workspace root, not daemon
      cwd.
- [x] `kato init` can seed a new workspace config from a reusable template in
      `~/.kato/kato-config.template.yaml`, when present.
- [x] Existing configs without the new fields keep the current generated-path
      behavior.
- [x] Generated paths still respect `allowedWriteRoots`.
- [x] Filename templating supports `snippetSlug` and UTC+0 date-part tokens from
      year down to seconds.

## Risks and Mitigations

- Risk: `defaultOutputDir` is ambiguous (file path vs directory path).
  Mitigation: define it explicitly as a base directory for generated
  destinations.
- Risk: template surface grows into a mini DSL. Mitigation: start with a fixed
  token list only.
- Risk: relative default paths accidentally depend on daemon cwd. Mitigation:
  resolve against workspace root only.
- Risk: relative explicit command args could escape the workspace unexpectedly.
  Mitigation: normalize, resolve against workspace root, then run the existing
  write-path policy gate on the final path.
- Risk: directory-path detection may be ambiguous for non-existent targets.
  Mitigation: define the contract explicitly (existing directory always counts
  as directory; non-existent path requires a trailing separator to opt into
  directory mode).
- Risk: a broken global config template could silently create bad workspace
  configs. Mitigation: validate the template before use and fail init clearly on
  errors.

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should the global config template be parsed as a full runtime config
      shape, or as a smaller partial schema limited to scaffoldable fields?
