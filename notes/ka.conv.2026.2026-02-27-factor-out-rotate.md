Rename `startOrRotateRecording` to `activateRecording`

Let's tackle [task.2026.2026-02-27-factor-out-rotate.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-27-factor-out-rotate.md) 

Let me know if you have any questions or see any issues we haven't addressed.

**Acknowledging rename request and planning inspection**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_0826_35

I’ll implement the rename from `startOrRotateRecording` to `activateRecording` and follow the task note you linked, then run targeted tests/searches to confirm nothing is missed. First I’m reading that task doc and locating all current call sites.

**Planning targeted code inspection**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_0826_44

I’ve confirmed all production and test callsites, and the task scope is consistent with what’s in the repo. Next I’ll apply a strict breaking rename in writer/orchestrator/tests, then run the two focused tests and a final grep sweep for old symbols.

**Planning symbol rename approach**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_0826_52

I’ve identified the exact implementation points. I’m now patching the core pipeline/types/exports/runtime first, then I’ll do a broad test rename pass including `rotatedTargets` variables and log assertions.

**Planning bulk variable renames**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_0827_01

I’m applying a targeted rename across the six code/test files only, with no compatibility wrappers. After that I’ll inspect diffs for any semantic cleanup needed beyond raw text replacement.

**Planning codebase cleanup inspection**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_0827_06

The mechanical rename is in place. I’m now reviewing the changed sections and running a sweep for any remaining old symbols before executing tests.

**Planning targeted parallel tests**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_0827_11

The rename is clean in source and tests from a symbol-sweep perspective. I’m running the two focused test files now to catch any behavioral/assertion fallout.

**Rerunning tests with write permissions**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_0827_23

The only test failures are permission-gate failures (`--allow-write`), not rename regressions. I’m rerunning `daemon-runtime_test.ts` with the required Deno write permission to validate behavior.

**Deciding read-permission flag**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_0827_32

`daemon-runtime_test.ts` also needs read permissions in this environment, so I’m running it with full Deno test permissions to verify actual test behavior after the rename.

**Checking for old names**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_0827_46

I’m doing a final naming polish/sweep now to catch readability leftovers (like helper variable names that still say “rotate”) and confirm no old API/event symbols remain in code.

**Preparing single-file patch**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_0827_49

I found one leftover helper variable (`startOrRotateCalls`) in `daemon-runtime_test.ts`; I’m renaming it to keep the test language aligned with the new API.

**Planning parallel test reruns**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_0827_56

I’ve finished the naming cleanup. I’m rerunning both targeted tests with permissions to confirm the final state is green.

**Conducting final grep sweep**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_0828_02

Both focused test suites are passing. I’m running one last grep sweep for the deprecated symbol/event names to verify we left no runtime aliases behind.

**Reviewing test naming for clarity**

**Planning task file checks and line references**

**Noticing preexisting unrelated changes**

**Summarizing rename implementation**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_0828_48

Implemented the one-shot breaking rename to `activateRecording` across runtime, API surface, and tests.

- [recording_pipeline.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/writer/recording_pipeline.ts:35):  
  `StartOrRotateRecordingInput` -> `ActivateRecordingInput`, `startOrRotateRecording(...)` -> `activateRecording(...)`, and log key/message `recording.rotate` -> `recording.activate` / `"Recording stream activated"`.
- [writer/mod.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/writer/mod.ts:28) and [mod.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/mod.ts:143): updated exported type name to `ActivateRecordingInput`.
- [daemon_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:867): updated control-command callsites to `recordingPipeline.activateRecording(...)`.
- [recording-pipeline_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/recording-pipeline_test.ts:197): updated all method invocations.
- [daemon-runtime_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts:1764): updated mocks/calls/assertions and helper names (`activatedTargets`, `activateCalls`).

Validation run:
- `deno test -A tests/recording-pipeline_test.ts` -> 10 passed
- `deno test -A tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts` -> 28 passed
- Repo sweep (excluding `dev-docs`): no matches for `StartOrRotateRecordingInput`, `startOrRotateRecording(`, or `recording.rotate`.

No blocking questions. One expected follow-up risk: any external consumers keyed on `recording.rotate` need to switch to `recording.activate`.

# User_2026-02-27_0829_49

Do we need to clean our state (meta)?

**Checking impact of rename on persisted metadata**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_0829_57

I’ll verify whether this rename touched any persisted metadata schema or on-disk state keys, then check current `.kato` state files for rotate-era fields.

**Inspecting shared session metadata schema**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_0830_05

I confirmed this rename did not obviously touch session metadata storage paths, but I’m doing one precise pass on the metadata schema/types to be certain no on-disk key changed.

**Inspecting shared session contract**

**Confirming no metadata cleanup needed**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_0830_17

Short answer is likely no, but I’m grabbing exact schema/log call locations so I can answer conclusively and note the only cases where cleanup is useful.

**Confirming no metadata cleanup needed**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_0830_31

No, not for this rename.

- Persisted session metadata schema and keys did not change (`schemaVersion` is still `1`, same `recordings` shape): [session_state.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/shared/src/contracts/session_state.ts:3), [session_state.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/shared/src/contracts/session_state.ts:31).
- The change is API/log naming only (`activateRecording`, `recording.activate`): [recording_pipeline.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/writer/recording_pipeline.ts:93), [recording_pipeline.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/writer/recording_pipeline.ts:276).

Only practical step: restart any running daemon process so it picks up the new code.  
Optional cleanup is just for hygiene (e.g. test artifacts under `.kato/test-*`), not correctness.
