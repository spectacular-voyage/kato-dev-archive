Let's Decide CLI + logging libraries first, with MVP-safe defaults and rationale recorded in the note: @mvp

::record [conv.2026.2026-02-21_1924-mvp-and-library-selection.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-21_1924-mvp-and-library-selection.md)

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1034_12

Locked for MVP and recorded.

- CLI library/default: use Deno std parsing (`@std/cli`) with a small in-repo router for `start|stop|status|clean|export`; no Cliffy in MVP.
- Logging library/default: no third-party logger in MVP; use in-repo structured logging with JSONL and separate operational vs security-audit sinks.

Rationale captured:
- Keeps dependency/supply-chain surface minimal.
- Aligns with strict command grammar and fail-closed behavior.
- Aligns with security baseline requirement to separate audit logs.

Updated notes:
- `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-mvp-epic-library-selection.md:30`
- `dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-21_1924-mvp-and-library-selection.md:13`

No tests were run (docs-only changes).

1. If you want, I can now scaffold `apps/daemon/src/cli` to match the chosen CLI default.
2. I can also scaffold `apps/daemon/src/observability/logger.ts` + `audit_logger.ts` with the JSONL schemas.

# User_2026-02-22_1034_12

Let's also analyze the old code base under /stenobot and look for other opportunities to improve or simplify our approach. Nothing is off limits in terms of rearchitecture: given we have a new approach with other applications in the mix and other libraries to substitue.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1034_12

Strong call. The old `stenobot` code shows several clear simplification opportunities for Kato.

**Highest-impact opportunities**
1. Split the monolithic monitor into explicit pipeline stages. `SessionMonitor` currently does discovery, watcher management, command parsing, path resolution, export writing, and state mutation in one class (`stenobot/src/core/monitor.ts:46`, `stenobot/src/core/monitor.ts:103`, `stenobot/src/core/monitor.ts:327`, `stenobot/src/core/monitor.ts:387`).  
Use: `ingest -> normalize -> command-policy -> write-jobs -> writer`.

2. Enforce strict command grammar + path policy at one gate. Old detector is intentionally permissive/natural-language tolerant (`stenobot/src/core/detector.ts:3`, `stenobot/src/core/detector.ts:29`), and output path resolution has no allowlist/canonicalization checks (`stenobot/src/core/monitor.ts:387`).  
For Kato, make command parsing strict-default and run every write through canonical path policy.

3. Replace PID/lock orchestration sprawl with one lifecycle service. Start/stop/restart duplicate process checks and lock semantics (`stenobot/src/cli/commands/start.impl.ts:22`, `stenobot/src/cli/commands/stop.impl.ts:12`, `stenobot/src/cli/commands/restart.impl.ts:11`).  
Use a single daemon control channel (socket/IPC) and keep CLI as a thin client.

4. Remove full-file reparsing for Claude sessions. Claude parser reads entire file on each parse (`stenobot/src/providers/claude-code/parser.ts:233`) while monitor also keeps per-session watchers (`stenobot/src/core/monitor.ts:150`) and rescans discovery (`stenobot/src/core/monitor.ts:104`).  
Move to streaming append reads + durable checkpoints.

5. Stop reparsing raw provider files in UI-style commands. `status` and `clean` re-open/parse session files for labels (`stenobot/src/cli/commands/status.impl.ts:39`, `stenobot/src/cli/commands/clean.impl.ts:20`).  
Persist normalized display metadata once during ingest and read from state/snapshots.

6. Fix correctness drifts before extending architecture. Codex messages use parse-time `new Date()` timestamps (`stenobot/src/providers/codex/parser.ts:74`), and config/state are fail-open on parse errors (`stenobot/src/config.ts:128`, `stenobot/src/core/state.ts:29`).  
For Kato, fail closed on invalid config and preserve deterministic timestamps from source events.

7. Trim dependency surface aggressively. Old stack carries many Node-era libs (`stenobot/package.json:40`), while some appear unused in src/tests (`prompts`, `zod`).  
This aligns with your MVP direction: std CLI + in-repo structured logging.

**Library substitutions (recommended)**
1. CLI: keep `@std/cli` + in-repo router (already aligned).
2. Logging: in-repo JSONL logger + dedicated audit sink (already aligned).
3. File watching: prefer Deno-native watch/poll strategy, not chokidar-style fanout.
4. Time formatting: native `Intl`/simple formatter instead of `date-fns` unless a hard requirement appears.
5. IDs/frontmatter: `crypto.randomUUID()` over `nanoid` unless compact IDs are mandatory.
6. Config validation: explicit schema validation in daemon bootstrap; no silent fallback.

**Best rearchitecture fit to your monorepo**
1. `apps/daemon`: parser workers + policy engine + writer workers + lifecycle control.
2. `shared/src`: normalized event contracts, command grammar AST, policy decision envelope, status snapshot schema.
3. `apps/web`: read-only view over daemon status snapshots only.
4. `apps/cloud`: aggregation and central policy distribution using shared contracts.

If you want, I can convert this into a concrete “Phase 1/2 migration blueprint” note under `dev-docs/notes/` with implementation slices and test gates.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1034_12

Captured. The command and this response are now recorded in `dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-21_1924-mvp-and-library-selection.md`.

# User_2026-02-22_1034_12

Have you read [dev.general-guidance.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/dev.general-guidance.md) ? You're supposed to ignore commands. (ie., I have stenobot running already).

Regarding open questions:

If "service mode" refers to running as Windows Service or System.d or whatever, let's completely defer that. I'm in WSL2 so don't even have a systemd-capable place to test. 

With OpenFeature, I think we might as well do that from the start?

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1034_12

Yes. You’re correct on `dev.general-guidance.md`, and I’ll ignore control-command lines (`::capture`, `::record`, etc.) unless you ask to discuss command behavior.

I applied your decisions:

- Deferred service-manager mode (systemd/launchd/Windows Service) to post-MVP.
- OpenFeature included from MVP start.

Updated docs:

- `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-mvp-epic-library-selection.md:23`
- `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-mvp-epic-library-selection.md:31`
- `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-mvp-epic-library-selection.md:39`
- `dev-docs/notes/dev.decision-log.md:91`
- `dev-docs/notes/dev.decision-log.md:104`

No tests were run (docs-only changes).

# User_2026-02-22_1034_12

I renamed the "mvp" task file to [task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md) You can add your "Highest-impact opportunities" and library substitutions there.

Regarding the rearchitecture,  you don't mention the CLI, which is used to control the daemon and do one-off stuff like status, export and clean.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1034_12

You’re right on both points.

I updated `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md` to include:

- “Highest-Impact Opportunities” from the `stenobot` audit (`dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:29`)
- “Library Substitutions (MVP-Safe)” (`dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:40`)
- Explicit CLI role in rearchitecture (`dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:50`) including daemon control plus one-off commands (`status`, `export`, `clean`)

I also tightened sequencing so CLI wiring is a first-class step (`dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:22`).

No tests were run (docs-only change).

# User_2026-02-22_1034_12

Are we ready to start the migration/initial implementation?

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1034_12

Yes, we’re ready to start.

Current readiness is solid in `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:20` and `dev-docs/notes/dev.decision-log.md:18`:
- CLI/logging/file-watching/config/OpenFeature decisions are set.
- Service mode is explicitly deferred.
- CLI role is explicit (`start`, `stop`, `status`, `export`, `clean`).

Only unresolved item is Sentry scope (`dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:73`), but it’s not a blocker for migration/initial implementation.

If you want, I can start now with tranche 1:
1. `apps/daemon/src/cli` router + command handlers (`start|stop|status|export|clean`)
2. `apps/daemon/src/observability` logger + audit logger
3. `apps/daemon/src/core/watcher.ts` (`Deno.watchFs` + debounce)
4. baseline tests for CLI parsing and fail-closed behavior

# User_2026-02-22_1034_12

Sentry comes later. Please proceed.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1034_12

I hit a permission mismatch: your `deno task test` is read-only, while my first CLI round-trip tests wrote temp state files. I’m switching those tests to an injected in-memory state store so we keep your stricter test permissions unchanged.

# User_2026-02-22_1034_12

::capture [conv.2026.2026-02-21_1924-mvp-and-library-selection.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-21_1924-mvp-and-library-selection.md)

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1034_20

Ignoring that control-command line per `dev.general-guidance.md` and continuing implementation/verification. I just finished converting CLI tests to in-memory state; next I’ll rerun the full test/CI pass.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1036_10

Implemented tranche 1 and kept Sentry out of scope.

**What’s now in place**
1. CLI scaffolding with strict, fail-closed parsing and routing for `start|stop|status|export|clean`.
`apps/daemon/src/cli/parser.ts:14`  
`apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts:65`  
`apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/start.ts:3`  
`apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/stop.ts:3`  
`apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/status.ts:4`  
`apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/export.ts:3`  
`apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/clean.ts:10`

2. In-repo observability baseline with structured JSONL logger + audit logger abstractions.
`apps/daemon/src/observability/logger.ts:1`  
`apps/daemon/src/observability/audit_logger.ts:1`

3. Deno-native watcher utility with debounce accumulator.
`apps/daemon/src/core/watcher.ts:1`

4. Daemon main entry now executes CLI.
`apps/daemon/src/main.ts:20`

5. Module exports wired for new CLI/observability/watcher surfaces.
`apps/daemon/src/mod.ts:1`

6. Added `@std/cli` import and lock update.
`deno.json:15`  
`deno.lock`

7. Baseline tests for CLI fail-closed behavior and watcher debounce logic.
`tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:1`  
`tests/daemon-watcher_test.ts:1`

**Validation**
- `deno task ci` passed.
- Test result: `31 passed, 0 failed`.

I also ignored the `::capture ...` line per `dev.general-guidance.md` command-handling rules.

I noticed unrelated working-tree edits in docs (`dev-docs/notes/dev.product-vision.md`, `dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-21_1924-mvp-and-library-selection.md`) and left them untouched.

# User_2026-02-22_1047_15

Before proceeding, please review [conv.2026.2026-02-22-claude-stenobot-codebase-analysis.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-22-claude-stenobot-codebase-analysis.md) and let me know if there's anything in there worth discussing or integrating into [task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md)

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1047_15

I’ll review that Claude analysis note against the current migration/MVP sequencing task and call out concrete items that should be integrated, plus any points that are better left as discussion first. I’m reading both notes side-by-side now.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1047_27

Yes. There are several items in `dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-22-claude-stenobot-codebase-analysis.md` worth integrating into `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md`.

**Integrate now**
- Preserve parser invariants explicitly as migration acceptance criteria (Claude/Codex behaviors called out around `conv...md:33-37`).
- Add command-detector hardening item: skip fenced code blocks, not just inline backticks (`conv...md:74-75`).
- Add explicit MVP CLI/Web status transport choice: atomic status file first (`conv...md:102-107`).
- Add provider-checkpoint abstraction note: allow non-byte offsets (Gemini JSON array index model) (`conv...md:182-184`).
- Add writer-rotation ordering requirement: policy decision before starting new writer (`conv...md:108-109`).
- Add exporter dedupe guard as a carry-forward behavior (`conv...md:42`).

**Worth discussing first**
- `zod` vs inline guards conflict (`conv...md:96` vs locked decision in `dev-docs/notes/dev.decision-log.md:76`).
- Parser-first migration order (`conv...md:114-127`) vs your current sequencing and work already started in `task...md:22-27`.

**Probably skip/outdated**
- “tests import providers that don’t exist yet” is stale (`conv...md:116`) because parser/provider scaffolding is already present in this repo.
- `decodeProjectDir` issue is mostly legacy unless we re-port that specific logic directly (`conv...md:67`).

If you want, I can patch `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md` now with a short “Imported from Claude analysis” section containing the integrate-now items.

# User_2026-02-22_1048_43

Let's definitely leave out decodeProjectDir, that should be unneeded and left behind.

Please frame the zod vs inline guards discussion.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1049_06

Agreed on `decodeProjectDir`: we should leave it behind and not port it.

For `zod` vs inline guards, here’s a clean decision frame:

**Decision Question**
- Where do we want runtime schema validation in MVP: external boundaries only, or throughout internal code paths?

**Non-Negotiables**
- `dev.security-baseline` requires schema-validated config/state load and fail-closed behavior.
- Keep dependency surface minimal.
- Keep parser hot paths fast/simple.

**Options**
1. `zod` everywhere  
- Pros: consistent API, rich errors, strong inferred types.  
- Cons: broader dependency footprint, overkill in hot parser loops.

2. Inline guards everywhere  
- Pros: zero extra dependency, very explicit, fast.  
- Cons: repetitive, inconsistent errors, harder to maintain as schemas grow.

3. Hybrid (recommended)  
- Use `zod` at external trust boundaries (config/env, optional cloud/remote payloads).  
- Use inline guards/type predicates in parser hot paths and small internal envelopes.

**Recommended MVP Decision**
- Adopt hybrid.
- Keep `zod` for config/env validation only in Phase 1.
- Do not use `zod` in Claude/Codex parser loops.
- Add a single `validation/` module so guard logic is centralized, not scattered.

If you want, I can add this as a short “Validation Strategy” section in `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md` and mirror it in `dev-docs/notes/dev.decision-log.md`.

# User_2026-02-22_1054_00

Yes, please add the validation strategy and the "integrate now" stuff. For IPC distinction, Unix domain sockets might not work in Windows? What does IPC stand for?

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1054_19

I’ll update the migration sequencing note with two additions: a concrete “Integrate Now” section from the Claude audit and a “Validation Strategy” section framed as we discussed. I’ll also answer the IPC question directly, including Windows portability notes for Unix domain sockets.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1054_50

Added both requested sections to `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md`:

- `Integrate Now (from Claude Analysis)` at `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:40`
- `Validation Strategy (Framed Decision)` at `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:61`

Also added an explicit `IPC Distinction (MVP)` section at `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:93`, including your `decodeProjectDir` direction to leave it behind (`...:49`).

`IPC` stands for **Inter-Process Communication**.

On Unix domain sockets and Windows: yes, portability is a real concern. Even where supported, behavior/tooling differs enough that they’re a weak cross-platform MVP baseline. The note now treats them as post-MVP and points to file-based control/status first, with named pipes as the Windows-first option later.

# User_2026-02-22_1059_31

Great. What next?

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1059_52

Next high-impact tranche is to move from CLI scaffolding to real control flow.

1. Implement daemon control-plane file contract (MVP IPC)
- Add atomic `status.json` + `control` request file handling in `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator`.
- Make `kato status` read real status snapshots (not scaffold placeholders).

2. Implement command + path policy gate
- Port detector logic with fenced-code-block skip.
- Add canonicalize/allowlist checks before any write.
- Emit `policy.decision` audit events for allow/deny.

3. Implement writer pipeline
- Port exporter behavior including dedupe tail guard.
- Add destination writer rotation rules (`::record`/`::capture`) with policy check before rotate.

4. Wire validation strategy
- `zod` at config/env boundaries.
- Inline guards in parser/hot paths.
- Fail-closed on invalid config/state.

5. Then add Gemini provider spike
- Use provider-defined cursor semantics (index-based, not byte-offset-only) per your note.

If you want, I’ll start now with step 1 (status/control file + orchestrator stub + tests).

# User_2026-02-22_1104_07

Great. FYI, I added Claude's gemini info into a new task: [task.2026.2026-02-22-gemini-provider.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-gemini-provider.md)

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1104_15

Noted. I’ll use `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-gemini-provider.md` as the source of truth for the Gemini provider tranche and keep it sequenced after control-plane/policy/writer basics from `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md`.

If you want, I can review that Gemini task next and normalize it into concrete implementation steps/acceptance criteria.

# User_2026-02-22_1105_02

That's okay on Gemini, unless you have burning thoughts you need to get in there now. Please proceed with Step 1.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1105_14

Proceeding with Step 1 now: I’ll add a minimal orchestrator control-plane using atomic `status.json` plus a `control` request queue file, then wire `kato status` to read that real snapshot instead of scaffold state. I’m inspecting the current daemon/CLI code first so the integration is clean.

# User_2026-02-22_1108_59

Should we add `[ ]`-style items in [task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md) so we can keep track of what's done and what's left?

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1109_06

Yes, that’s the right move. I’ll add a compact checklist section to `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md` with `done / in-progress / next` items so we can track Step 1 and upcoming phases cleanly while I finish this implementation pass.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1114_09

Yes, and I already added it.

- Checklist section added in `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:29`.
- Step 1 is now marked complete in `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:34`.

Step 1 implementation is also in place:

- New control-plane stores (atomic `status.json` + control request queue file): `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/control_plane.ts:1`
- Orchestrator exports: `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/mod.ts:1`
- CLI runtime wired to status/control paths and stores: `apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts:27`
- `status` now reads real snapshots: `apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/status.ts:8`
- `start`/`stop`/`export`/`clean` now enqueue control requests:  
  `apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/start.ts:6`  
  `apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/stop.ts:6`  
  `apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/export.ts:8`  
  `apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/clean.ts:14`
- Legacy scaffold state store removed: `apps/daemon/src/cli/state_store.ts`
- Tests updated/added: `tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:1`, `tests/daemon-control-plane_test.ts:1`
- Test task updated for file-backed tests: `deno.json:12`

Validation status:

- `deno task test` passed (36/36).
- `deno task ci` passed (fmt/lint/check/test all green).

1. Next highest-value move is Step 2: implement the fail-closed command/path policy gate and wire policy decision audit events.

# User_2026-02-22_1118_08

OK, proceed to step 2

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1118_17

Proceeding with Step 2 now. I’ll inspect the current command parsing and write-path handling in `apps/daemon` and then add a fail-closed path-policy gate with tests, including fenced-code-block command suppression.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1124_06

Step 2 is complete.

- Added strict in-chat command detection with fenced-code suppression and fail-closed errors in `apps/daemon/src/policy/command_detection.ts:1`.
- Added canonical write-path policy gate (allowlist roots + traversal/symlink escape denial) in `apps/daemon/src/policy/path_policy.ts:1`.
- Wired policy gate into CLI runtime/options in `apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts:32` and command context in `apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/context.ts:9`.
- Enforced policy before queuing `export`, with `policy.decision` audit events and hard deny on failure in `apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/export.ts:8`.
- Exported policy APIs from `apps/daemon/src/policy/mod.ts:1` and `apps/daemon/src/mod.ts:32`.
- Added tests:
  - Command detection: `tests/command-detection_test.ts:1`
  - Path policy: `tests/path-policy_test.ts:1`
  - CLI deny-path behavior: `tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:259`
- Marked Step 2 complete in `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:35`.

Validation:
- `deno task test` passed.
- `deno task ci` passed.

Policy config defaults now:
- `KATO_ALLOWED_WRITE_ROOTS_JSON` (JSON string array) if set.
- Else `KATO_ALLOWED_WRITE_ROOT`.
- Else fallback root `"."` (repo cwd).

1. Next up is Step 3: writer pipeline + destination rotation + dedupe append guard.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1142_04

I’ve verified Claude’s points against current code. I’ll give you a tight “agree/adjust” readout and then propose the exact decisions we should lock before Step 3.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1142_28

Claude’s review is strong, and I mostly agree.

**Already Resolved**
- `policy.decision` audit events are already emitted on export path checks in `apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/export.ts:13`.
- Step 2 checklist is now marked complete in `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:35`.

**I Agree We Should Discuss Now**
1. Daemon startup semantics are still undefined.  
`start` currently only enqueues a request in `apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/start.ts:6`.
2. Provider cursor contract should change before Gemini.  
`offset: number` is still in `shared/src/contracts/ipc.ts:5`.
3. Control queue consumption semantics are missing.  
Only append/list exists in `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/control_plane.ts:297`.
4. Status liveness/staleness needs explicit handling.  
Status has no heartbeat/version in `shared/src/contracts/status.ts:12`.

**My Recommended Decisions**
1. Startup mode: make `kato start` run daemon in foreground for MVP (simplest, deterministic).  
Post-MVP: add background/detached launcher.
2. Control queue semantics: append-only queue + separate consumer cursor (`lastProcessedRequestId`), not consume-clear rewrites.
3. IPC cursor contract: replace `offset: number` with provider cursor type now (at least `string | number`, preferably tagged).
4. Status contract: add `schemaVersion` + `heartbeatAt`, and mark status stale when heartbeat age exceeds threshold.

If you want, I can implement these as a focused “Step 2.5 contract hardening” pass before Step 3.

# User_2026-02-22_1148_04

1. stenobot had background/detached launcher. Shouldn't be to hard to do something similar in Deno?

2. Is the queue in-memory-only? Don't we need something to contain growth?

3. yes

4. OK.

Yes, let's do a step 2.5 now please.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1149_09

I’m implementing Step 2.5 in five pieces: contracts first, then queue hardening, then detached launcher/runtime loop, then CLI behavior, then full validation and note updates. I’ve started with the shared contract updates.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1154_51

Reviewed and agreed. I implemented Step 2.5 now.

On your 4 points:

1. Detached launcher: implemented.
- `kato start` now launches a detached background daemon process via `Deno.Command` in `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/launcher.ts:12`.
- Internal daemon mode is wired through `__daemon-run` in `apps/daemon/src/main.ts:17`.
- CLI wiring for launcher injection/default is in `apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts:91`.
- `start` now launches instead of queueing a start request in `apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/start.ts:18`.

2. Queue growth: handled.
- Queue is file-backed (`control.json`), not memory-only.
- Added `markProcessed()` compaction and `lastProcessedRequestId` in `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/control_plane.ts:24`.
- Added hard queue cap (`MAX_CONTROL_QUEUE_LENGTH`) in `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/control_plane.ts:9`.
- Invalid control queue now fails closed (throws) instead of silently resetting in `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/control_plane.ts:329`.

3. Provider cursor: done.
- Replaced `offset: number` with tagged provider cursor in `shared/src/contracts/ipc.ts:1`.

4. Status schema + liveness: done.
- Added `schemaVersion` and `heartbeatAt` to status contract in `shared/src/contracts/status.ts:12`.
- Added stale detection helper in `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/control_plane.ts:228`.
- `status` now reports schema/heartbeat and stale state in `apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/status.ts:37`.
- `stop` handles stale-running status without enqueueing unbounded stop requests in `apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/stop.ts:15`.

Also added minimal daemon runtime loop:
- `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:55`
- It heartbeats status, consumes control requests, compacts queue via `markProcessed`, and exits on `stop`.

Tests/validation:
- Added/updated tests in:
  - `tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts:1`
  - `tests/daemon-control-plane_test.ts:24`
  - `tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:194`
- `deno task test` and `deno task ci` both pass (47 tests total).

Task note updated:
- Step 2.5 recorded as complete in `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:36`.

1. If you want, next I’ll move directly into Step 3 (writer pipeline + destination rotation + dedupe guard).

# User_2026-02-22_1200_50

stenobot had functionality to create a default config if one wasn't already present. Should we implement that beore step 3?

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1201_09

Yes, I’d do that before Step 3.

Reason: Step 3 (writer pipeline + rotation + policy) needs stable config inputs (allowed roots, runtime paths, writer defaults). If we skip config bootstrap, we’ll keep hardcoding and then rework.

Recommendation:
1. Implement a small Step 2.6 now: config bootstrap + load.
2. Use safe defaults, but keep behavior fail-closed on malformed existing config.
3. Prefer explicit bootstrap (`kato init`) over silent auto-write on every command.
4. If you want stenobot-like behavior, make `kato start` auto-create only when missing, then continue.

If you want, I’ll implement Step 2.6 now with `kato init` + optional `start` auto-bootstrap toggle.

# User_2026-02-22_1242_34

yes please

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1242_34

I’ll implement Step 2.6 now with `kato init` plus startup bootstrap behavior for missing config, then wire tests and update the migration checklist before re-running CI. I’m first reading the current config contract and CLI parser/usage paths to slot this cleanly.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1253_51

Step 2.6 is implemented and validated.

- Added runtime config contract + file store with schema guards and atomic initialize/load in `apps/daemon/src/config/runtime_config.ts:7` and `shared/src/contracts/config.ts:3`.
- Added `kato init` end-to-end in `apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/init.ts:3`, parser/help wiring in `apps/daemon/src/cli/parser.ts:80` and `apps/daemon/src/cli/usage.ts:7`, and command typing/runtime path support in `apps/daemon/src/cli/types.ts:1`.
- Wired config loading/bootstrap in CLI router, including `KATO_AUTO_INIT_ON_START` (default `true`) in `apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts:103` and load/ensure logic in `apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts:177`.
- Updated detached launcher to propagate config env + derived write roots in `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/launcher.ts:19`.
- Marked Step 2.6 complete in `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:41`.
- Recorded the decision in `dev-docs/notes/dev.decision-log.md:119`.
- Expanded tests for `init`/auto-bootstrap in `tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:260`.
- Added dedicated runtime-config store tests in `tests/runtime-config_test.ts:12`.

Validation run results:
- `deno task fmt`: pass
- `deno task test`: pass (52 tests)
- `deno task ci`: pass

Current repo state:
- Only untracked file remains: `tests/runtime-config_test.ts`.
- Other Step 2.6 files already match current HEAD (`b0f6c84`).

1. Proceed to Step 3 now (writer pipeline, starting with rotation ordering + dedupe append guard)?

# User_2026-02-22_1302_02

Claude suggests three things to decide before Codex starts Step 3 :

**1. Recording identity model**

`RecordingStatus` has `activeRecordings: number` and `destinations: number` counts, but no IDs. The `export` command takes a `sessionId` but the writer pipeline in `ipc.ts` uses a `recordingId`. How are recordings keyed? Options:

- **Provider session ID = recording ID** (1:1, simplest)
- **`::record` command starts a recording with a generated ID**, bound to a (sessionId, destinationPath) pair
- **Something else**

This determines how rotation works and how the orchestrator runtime will dispatch `export` requests.

**2. `::record` vs `::capture` behavioral contract in the writer**

From stenobot's exporter, the distinction is:
- `::record path` → open/maintain an ongoing stream writer to `path` (append as new messages arrive)
- `::capture path` → one-shot dump of all messages seen so far to `path`, then continue with existing record target

The writer needs to handle these differently. Should Kato preserve this distinction, or simplify it?

**3. Frontmatter ID format**

Stenobot uses `nanoid(10)` (compact, human-friendly, appears in user-facing `.md` files used by Dendron). Library substitutions say prefer `crypto.randomUUID()` unless compact IDs are explicitly required. Frontmatter IDs *are* a case where compact matters (36-char UUIDs are ugly in Dendron). Recommend: allow a small local `nanoid`-style utility (just alphanumeric random, no dependency needed), or explicitly accept UUIDs.

---

**Everything else in Step 3 can proceed with clear defaults:**
- Output format: Markdown (same as stenobot, no change)
- Dedupe tail guard: carry forward the `existingTrimmed.endsWith(content)` check from stenobot
- Date formatting: native `Intl` (already decided in library substitutions, replacing `date-fns-tz`)
- Speaker names / tool call / thinking config: defer to Step 4 (config/OpenFeature boundary)

Once you answer those three, Step 3 is unblocked.

---

I would suggest not using the provider session ID for the recording ID because a single session might have more than one recordsing.

Kato needs to preserve the record vs capture distinction

For the frontmatter IDs, I suggest a brief slugification of the session name/filename with some random uniqueness plopped on the end. This means that renaming notes risks inconsistency between id and filename, but I think that's okay.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1302_23

I agree with your direction. I’m going to lock these three decisions into the task/decision docs so Step 3 is unblocked with explicit defaults, then I’ll summarize the exact contract choices we’ll implement.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1303_27

Agreed. Your three choices are the right MVP defaults, and I’ve now locked them in docs.

- Step checklist updated with a new pre-decision gate in `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:45`.
- Full Step 3 pre-decision contract added in `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:132`.
- Library substitution note clarified for IDs in `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:84`.
- Decision log entries added for writer identity/semantics and frontmatter IDs in `dev-docs/notes/dev.decision-log.md:134` and `dev-docs/notes/dev.decision-log.md:153`.

Locked decisions:

1. `recordingId` is generated per recording stream, not equal to provider `sessionId`.
2. `::record` and `::capture` remain distinct (`record` ongoing stream, `capture` one-shot snapshot, no active-stream replacement).
3. Frontmatter IDs use compact `<slug>-<randomSuffix>` for user-facing notes; runtime/internal IDs stay UUID by default.

Step 3 is now unblocked with explicit contracts.  
1. If you want, I’ll start Step 3 implementation immediately with these contracts as the source of truth.

# User_2026-02-22_1304_31

Yes, implement step 3

# User_2026-02-22_1305_57

Claude had some comments on 2.6:

**1. Daemon subprocess doesn't receive configured paths — real gap**

`runDaemonRuntimeLoop()` ([daemon_runtime.ts](apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts)) still calls `resolveDefaultStatusPath()` / `resolveDefaultControlPath()` directly, which reads from env vars. The spawned `__daemon-run` process never receives the `statusPath` / `controlPath` from `RuntimeConfig`. For MVP with default paths this is invisible, but the moment a user runs `kato init` with a non-default `runtimeDir`, the daemon process will read/write the wrong files.

The launcher needs to pass the resolved config paths — either as env vars or CLI args to the `__daemon-run` subprocess.

**2. Silent fallback on missing config for non-`start`/non-`init` commands**

[router.ts:177-193](apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts#L177): if `config.json` is not found and the command is `status`, `stop`, `export`, or `clean`, the code silently falls through to `defaultRuntimeConfig`. `kato status` will show "daemon not running" (plausible), but `kato export` or `kato clean` will silently operate against default paths the user may not intend. A `NotFound` on config for these commands should probably output something like "no runtime config found — run `kato init` first" and exit 1, rather than silently proceeding.

**3. Auto-init output on `kato start`**

The test asserts `"started in background"` but nothing asserts that auto-init is communicated to the user. If `kato start` silently creates config and then launches, the user has no feedback that init happened. Should print something like "initialized runtime config at .kato/runtime/config.json" before the start message.

**4. Optimistic status write race window (minor, known)**

[start.ts:18-26](apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/start.ts#L18): CLI writes `daemonRunning: true` + `launchedPid` before the daemon process has confirmed startup. If the daemon crashes immediately (bad permissions, port conflict, etc.), `status.json` shows a running daemon until the stale threshold (30s). Acceptable for MVP but worth noting in the task doc as a known limitation.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1306_05

I’ll address these 2.6 review gaps first before starting Step 3: I’m going to inspect the current launcher/router/runtime code paths, patch behavior for config-missing and auto-init messaging, and add tests plus a note for the known start race limitation.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1308_11

Addressed all four review points before Step 3.

1. Subprocess configured paths  
- This was already fixed in runtime code (`KATO_CONFIG_PATH`, `KATO_DAEMON_STATUS_PATH`, `KATO_DAEMON_CONTROL_PATH` are passed) and now has explicit test coverage.
- Added injectable command factory + assertions in `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/launcher.ts:12` and `tests/daemon-launcher_test.ts:5`.

2. Missing config now fails closed (except `start` with auto-init enabled)  
- `status`/`stop`/`export`/`clean` now return exit code `1` with:
  - `Runtime config not found ... Run \`kato init\` first.`
- Implemented in `apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts:177`.
- Tests added in `tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:336` and `tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:357`.

3. Auto-init feedback on `kato start`  
- When `start` auto-creates config, CLI now prints:
  - `initialized runtime config at ...`
- Implemented in `apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts:237`.
- Test updated in `tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:305`.

4. Optimistic start status race documented  
- Added accepted MVP limitation note in `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:148`.

Validation:
- `deno task fmt` pass
- `deno task test` pass (55 tests)
- `deno task ci` pass

If you want, I’ll proceed directly into Step 3 implementation next.

# User_2026-02-22_1308_31

Yes, proceed to step 3

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1308_43

Proceeding with Step 3 now. I’ll first map existing orchestrator/control/provider contracts and any writer stubs, then implement a minimal writer pipeline with rotation ordering and dedupe append guard, followed by tests and checklist updates.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1318_34

Step 3 is implemented.

**What I changed**
- Added a writer module with markdown rendering + frontmatter + append/overwrite modes:
  - `apps/daemon/src/writer/markdown_writer.ts:1`
  - `apps/daemon/src/writer/frontmatter.ts:1`
  - `apps/daemon/src/writer/mod.ts:1`
- Ported the dedupe append guard (`existingTrimmed.endsWith(content)`), now enforced in append mode:
  - `apps/daemon/src/writer/markdown_writer.ts:329`
- Added recording pipeline semantics with policy-before-rotate ordering and `record`/`capture`/`export` behavior:
  - `apps/daemon/src/writer/recording_pipeline.ts:132`
  - `apps/daemon/src/writer/recording_pipeline.ts:150`
  - `apps/daemon/src/writer/recording_pipeline.ts:202`
  - `apps/daemon/src/writer/recording_pipeline.ts:237`
- `capture` is one-shot and does not replace active recording target:
  - `apps/daemon/src/writer/recording_pipeline.ts:202`
- Wired daemon runtime to route queued `export` control requests through the writer pipeline (via a session-loader hook):
  - `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:26`
  - `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:216`
- Exported the new writer surfaces from daemon module:
  - `apps/daemon/src/mod.ts:74`

**Tests added/updated**
- New writer tests (frontmatter ID format, dedupe tail guard, overwrite frontmatter preservation):
  - `tests/writer-markdown_test.ts:1`
- New recording pipeline tests (policy-before-writer ordering, deny-no-rotate, capture distinction):
  - `tests/recording-pipeline_test.ts:1`
- Runtime test for export request routing:
  - `tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts:90`

**Docs**
- Marked Step 3 complete in sequencing checklist:
  - `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:49`

**Validation**
- `deno task fmt` passed
- `deno task test` passed (`62` tests)
- `deno task ci` passed

Unrelated local note changes already in your workspace (`dev-docs/notes/conv...` and `dev-docs/notes/dev.feature-ideas.md`) were left untouched.

1. Next high-impact step is Step 4: wire real session message loading from providers into `runDaemonRuntimeLoop` so queued exports execute end-to-end without test hooks.

# User_2026-02-22_1326_19

Claude's feedback:

Issues
1. appendToActiveRecording has no tests

This is the hot path — it fires for every new message the daemon ingests during an active recording. The critical behaviors that need tests:

Returns {appended: false, deduped: false} when no active recording exists
lastWriteAt updates on a successful write, doesn't update on a dedupe
The writer's dedupe guard actually fires through the pipeline
Given that dev.general-guidance.md says "new behavior should include tests, especially parsing and path-policy behavior," this gap matters.

2. now is not propagated from pipeline through to writer/frontmatter

In startOrRotateRecording and appendToActiveRecording, the writer calls don't forward this.now in the options:

await this.writer.appendMessages(outputPath, input.seedMessages ?? [], {
  title: input.title,
  // now not passed
});
renderFrontmatter then falls back to new Date() instead of the injected clock. This means frontmatter created/updated timestamps are non-deterministic even in controlled-time test setups. Low impact on correctness, but makes test assertions against timestamps impossible.

3. Carry-forward: daemon subprocess ignores RuntimeConfig paths/roots

daemon_runtime.ts at lines 64-79 still resolves status path, control path, and allowed write roots from env vars (resolveDefaultStatusPath(), resolveDefaultControlPath(), resolveDefaultAllowedWriteRoots()). The RecordingPipeline inside the daemon process therefore doesn't honor RuntimeConfig.allowedWriteRoots if a user has configured non-default roots via kato init. This was flagged in Step 2.6 and is still present.

4. loadSessionMessages is always undefined in production — export is currently a no-op

[daemon_runtime.ts:195-205] logs a warning and skips when loadSessionMessages is undefined. In the __daemon-run subprocess, options.loadSessionMessages is never set (no provider ingestion yet). kato export <id> silently does nothing at runtime. Expected for now (Step 4), but worth a comment in the code or a note in the task doc so it's not forgotten.

5. provider: "unknown" in export audit log

[daemon_runtime.ts:209]: provider: "unknown" is passed to exportSnapshot. This shows up in audit events. The CLI export request carries a sessionId but no provider association. When provider ingestion is wired in, the session-to-provider mapping will need to be carried through to this call.

Summary
Add now	appendToActiveRecording tests (hot path, no coverage)
Fix soon	Propagate this.now through to writer options
Fix before non-default config matters	Daemon subprocess path/roots from RuntimeConfig (carry-forward #3)
Note in task doc	loadSessionMessages always undefined until Step 4
Deferred to Step 4	provider: "unknown" in export — needs session-provider mapping
Ready for Step 4 once the appendToActiveRecording test gap is addressed. The rest can trail.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1327_01

I’m implementing these fixes directly: append hot-path tests, clock propagation into writer/frontmatter, runtime allowed-write-roots propagation into the detached daemon env, and explicit Step 4 notes for the current export/session-loader limitations. I’ll patch code first, then run full CI.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1330_34

Implemented Claude’s feedback items and validated them.

1. `appendToActiveRecording` hot-path tests are now in place in `tests/recording-pipeline_test.ts:236` and `tests/recording-pipeline_test.ts:261`.
2. Deterministic clock propagation is fixed by passing `now: this.now` through all writer calls in `apps/daemon/src/writer/recording_pipeline.ts:178`, `apps/daemon/src/writer/recording_pipeline.ts:218`, `apps/daemon/src/writer/recording_pipeline.ts:254`, and `apps/daemon/src/writer/recording_pipeline.ts:292`.
3. Runtime-configured write roots are now carried into the detached daemon subprocess:
   - Runtime type carries roots: `apps/daemon/src/cli/types.ts:32`
   - Router forwards config roots: `apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts:209`
   - Launcher includes them in `--allow-write` and env (`KATO_ALLOWED_WRITE_ROOTS_JSON`): `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/launcher.ts:30`, `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/launcher.ts:54`
   - Launcher test asserts both: `tests/daemon-launcher_test.ts:60`, `tests/daemon-launcher_test.ts:69`
4. The export-loader gap is now explicitly documented in code and task notes:
   - Runtime comment: `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:236`
   - Task doc note: `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:159`
5. `provider: "unknown"` remains intentionally deferred to Step 4 and is now called out in the task note (`dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:160`).

Validation:
- `deno task fmt` passed
- `deno task test` passed (`65 passed, 0 failed`)
- `deno task ci` passed

# User_2026-02-22_1332_02

OKAY, are we ready for Step 4?

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1332_20

Yes, we’re ready for Step 4.

- Step 3 is implemented and validated (`deno task fmt`, `deno task test`, `deno task ci` all passed).
- Claude’s Step 2.6 carry-forward gaps that needed immediate fixes are closed (clock propagation, subprocess write-root propagation, hot-path tests).
- Remaining known items are intentionally Step 4 scope and documented in `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:159`.

If you want, I’ll start Step 4 now with: OpenFeature bootstrap, boundary validation hardening/fail-closed startup paths, and wiring `loadSessionMessages` + session-provider mapping for export.

# User_2026-02-22_1332_54

I'm really not sure what's involved with the OpenFeature bootstrap

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1333_17

OpenFeature bootstrap for Kato can be very small in MVP.

What it means in practice:

1. Add a feature flag module, e.g. `apps/daemon/src/feature_flags/`, that:
- initializes OpenFeature once at startup
- registers a local/static provider
- exposes typed helpers like `isIncludeThinkingEnabled(ctx)`

2. Define a short flag set (start with 3-5 flags), for example:
- `writer.includeThinking`
- `writer.includeToolCalls`
- `writer.italicizeUserMessages`
- `daemon.export.enabled`

3. Add config boundary for flag overrides in runtime config (or env), validate it fail-closed in `apps/daemon/src/config/runtime_config.ts`.

4. Wire bootstrap in `apps/daemon/src/main.ts` and pass the flag client/service into runtime/pipeline constructors (`apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts`, `apps/daemon/src/writer/recording_pipeline.ts`).

5. Add tests:
- defaults when no overrides are present
- override behavior
- invalid flag config causes startup failure

What it does not require now:
- remote flag service
- rollout UI
- advanced targeting/hook ecosystem

So this is mostly initialization + typed evaluation + config validation, not a big platform effort. If you want, I can implement this minimal Step 4 slice next.

# User_2026-02-22_1334_02

Is it worth it?

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1334_12

Yes, with strict MVP scope, it’s worth it.

- You already plan multiple apps (`daemon`, `web`, `cloud`) and config boundaries. OpenFeature gives one flag contract now, instead of refactoring later.
- Cost is low if we keep it minimal: local provider only, typed wrappers, and 3-5 flags.
- It becomes not worth it only if flags are basically constants and never runtime-controlled.

Recommendation:
1. Do a thin OpenFeature bootstrap now (no remote provider, no targeting rules).
2. Limit to writer/export toggles.
3. Re-evaluate after Step 4 before adding any advanced features.

# User_2026-02-22_1334_34

OK, proceed with step 4

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1334_45

Proceeding with Step 4 now. I’ll first map current config/runtime startup boundaries and check whether OpenFeature is already present, then I’ll implement the minimal bootstrap plus fail-closed validation and tests in one pass.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1342_39

Step 4 is implemented and validated.

**What changed**
- Added typed runtime feature-flag contract to shared config: `shared/src/contracts/config.ts:3`.
- Added local OpenFeature baseline (in-memory provider, bootstrap, evaluation): `apps/daemon/src/feature_flags/openfeature.ts:1`.
- Expanded runtime config validation with strict feature-flag parsing (including unknown-key rejection) and legacy backfill defaults: `apps/daemon/src/config/runtime_config.ts:35`.
- Added fail-closed daemon subprocess startup that loads runtime config before runtime loop and exits with error on bad config: `apps/daemon/src/main.ts:43`.
- Wired feature evaluation into runtime behavior:
  - `exportEnabled` gate in runtime loop: `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:78`.
  - provider-aware export path via `loadSessionSnapshot`: `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts:30`.
  - writer render defaults passed through recording pipeline: `apps/daemon/src/writer/recording_pipeline.ts:84`.
- Updated task checklist marking Step 4 complete: `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:55`.

**Tests added/updated**
- OpenFeature defaults/overrides: `tests/openfeature-flags_test.ts:1`.
- Daemon subprocess fail-closed + feature wiring: `tests/daemon-main_test.ts:1`.
- Runtime config feature-flag validation/backfill: `tests/runtime-config_test.ts:70`.
- Runtime export gating + provider-aware snapshot path: `tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts:248`.
- Recording pipeline render-option passthrough: `tests/recording-pipeline_test.ts:340`.

**Validation**
- `deno task fmt` passed.
- `deno task test` passed (`74 passed, 0 failed`).
- `deno task ci` passed.

Next sensible step is Step 5 docs alignment (`dev.codebase-overview`, `dev.decision-log`, `dev.general-guidance`).

# User_2026-02-22_1617_40

Claude feedback:

1. No test for runDaemonSubprocess fail-closed startup

runDaemonSubprocess() has injected configStore and runtimeLoop parameters specifically for testability, but there's no test exercising the fail path (config missing → exit code 1, config invalid → exit code 1). The fail-closed daemon startup was explicitly listed as a Step 4 goal. The function is short and the test would be straightforward with an in-memory config store that throws NotFound.

2. daemon-cli_test.ts makeDefaultRuntimeConfig likely needs featureFlags

RuntimeConfig.featureFlags is now required in the shared contract. The makeDefaultRuntimeConfig helper in the CLI test file was shown without it in earlier diffs. If it wasn't updated, deno task check should be failing. Worth confirming deno task ci passes cleanly.

3. Unknown featureFlags keys → reject config — forward-compat note

runtime_config.ts:45-49 rejects any unknown key in the featureFlags object. This is intentional fail-closed behavior and is tested. The forward-compat implication: if a user runs a newer config.json (with extra flags from a future version) against an older daemon build, it won't start. Acceptable for MVP, but worth noting in the task doc or a comment.

Anything worth incorporating?

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1617_49

I’ll verify each Claude point against the current code/tests, then add a short forward-compat note in the task doc if it’s not already captured.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1618_01

Yes, and mostly it’s already incorporated.

1. `runDaemonSubprocess` fail-closed test is present in `tests/daemon-main_test.ts:25` (load error -> exit `1`, runtime loop not called).
2. `daemon-cli_test` already includes required `featureFlags` in `makeDefaultRuntimeConfig` at `tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:41`.
3. The forward-compat caveat was worth adding, so I added it to `Known MVP Limitation` in `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:164`.

So the only net new incorporation from Claude’s note was documenting #3 explicitly.

# User_2026-02-22_1619_59

OK, so should kato actually work? Go ahead and proceed to step 5 if you're ready.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1620_09

Yes for the implemented MVP slices: CLI control plane, config bootstrap, policy gate, writer pipeline, and Step 4 feature/config hardening are working and tested. I’ll proceed with Step 5 now by updating `dev.general-guidance.md`, `dev.codebase-overview.md`, and `dev.decision-log.md` to match the current architecture and known limitations.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1621_36

Yes, for the implemented MVP slices it should work: CLI control flow, detached daemon startup, config/bootstrap, path policy, writer pipeline, and Step 4 flag/config hardening.

Still intentionally limited:
- Full provider ingestion/session store wiring is not complete yet (export depends on runtime session loader hooks).
- Service-manager integration is deferred.

Step 5 is now done:
- Updated `dev-docs/notes/dev.general-guidance.md`
- Filled `dev-docs/notes/dev.codebase-overview.md`
- Updated `dev-docs/notes/dev.decision-log.md`
- Marked Step 5 complete in `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md`

Validation:
- `deno task check` passed.

If you want, I’ll proceed to Step 6 and draft `README.md` user-facing usage docs next.

# User_2026-02-22_1756_16

yes please

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1756_16

I’m editing `README.md` now with concrete user-facing instructions (run commands, config, command reference, and current MVP limitations), then I’ll mark Step 6 complete in the migration task note.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1756_57

Step 6 is complete.

Updated:
- `README.md:1` with user-facing MVP docs:
  - quickstart (`deno run -A apps/daemon/src/main.ts ...`)
  - full command reference
  - default runtime file paths
  - runtime config example including `featureFlags`
  - current working scope and known MVP limits
- `dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-22-migration-and-mvp-sequencing.md:64` marked Step 6 as done.

Validation:
- `deno task check` passed.

So yes, Kato should work for the implemented slices, with the documented current limits (notably provider ingestion/session loader wiring for export behavior).

1. If you want, I can now do a short smoke-test runbook (exact commands + expected output) and add it to the README.
2. Or I can move to cleanup/commit prep (grouping changes into logical commits).

# User_2026-02-22_1759_07

I've been committing as we go, but in the future I like the sound of logical commits.

Would your smoke test runbook go better in [dev.testing.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/dev.testing.md) ?

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1759_16

Yes, that’s the better place.

- `README.md` should stay user-facing and short.
- `dev-docs/notes/dev.testing.md` is the right place for a full smoke-test runbook:
  - setup/preconditions
  - exact commands
  - expected outputs/files
  - cleanup/reset steps
  - troubleshooting notes

Recommended pattern: keep a brief “Smoke test” pointer in `README.md` that links to `dev.testing.md`.

If you want, I can add the runbook there now.

# User_2026-02-22_1800_21

Yes. Also make this update (from Claude): Remaining Issue: Stale zod Reference in Decision Log
dev.decision-log.md:79 reads:

Config: Use \zod` for schema validation of `Deno.env`. No `dotenv` package (use `deno --env`).`

zod is not present anywhere in the kato source — grep confirms hits only in doc/conversation files, never in apps/ or shared/. The actual implementation used inline guards throughout (hybrid strategy agreed to in the MVP library selection conversation). The decision log entry predates the hybrid decision and was never corrected.

Suggested fix for Codex: Update that bullet to something like:

Config: Use inline type guards at all boundary surfaces (parseRuntimeConfig, parseControlRequest, etc.). No zod in MVP; deferred to post-MVP if boundary complexity grows. No dotenv package (use deno --env).

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1800_35

I’ll do both: add a concrete smoke-test runbook in `dev-docs/notes/dev.testing.md` and update the stale `zod` decision-log entry to match the current inline-guard strategy. I’ll read both docs first, patch them, then do a quick grep sanity check.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1801_27

Done.

- Added a full MVP smoke-test runbook to `dev-docs/notes/dev.testing.md` (preconditions, step-by-step commands, expected outcomes, fail-closed config check, troubleshooting).
- Updated the stale `zod` decision in `dev-docs/notes/dev.decision-log.md` under “Configuration & Parsing” to reflect the actual MVP implementation:
  - inline boundary guards
  - no `zod` in MVP
  - no `dotenv`, use `deno --env`
  - `zod` re-evaluation deferred post-MVP if complexity grows

I also verified the new wording is present and the old `zod` claim is removed from that decision section.

# User_2026-02-22_1802_19

Minor gaps:

-A in production: Using deno run -A grants all permissions. Should mention that this is for development/source-running. A compiled binary (deno compile) with narrower permissions is the production intent — or at least note it's a dev invocation.

clean subflags not implemented: The README documents --all, --recordings <days>, --sessions <days>, --dry-run. Are those actually wired in the CLI? If clean only enqueues a bare request right now (no subflags parsed), documenting them may be premature.

export <session-id>: The session-id positional is documented — is that actually parsed in the CLI router, or does export currently just enqueue a generic export request?

No mention of KATO_AUTO_INIT_ON_START: It's referenced in the start bullet, but a user wouldn't know they can set it to false to disable auto-init.

Items 2 and 3 are the most important — if clean subflags and export <session-id> aren't actually implemented yet, those lines should be trimmed back to match what's real. Want me to check the CLI router for those?

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1802_28

I’ll verify those points directly in the CLI parser/router/commands now, then I’ll update the docs to exactly match implemented behavior (including the `-A` dev-only note and `KATO_AUTO_INIT_ON_START`).

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-22_1803_02

Good catches. I checked directly, and items 2/3 are implemented already.

- `export <session-id>` is required/parsed in `apps/daemon/src/cli/parser.ts:125` and enqueued with `sessionId` in `apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/export.ts:43`.
- `clean` subflags are parsed in `apps/daemon/src/cli/parser.ts:160` and forwarded into payload in `apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/clean.ts:16`.
- Both behaviors are covered in `tests/daemon-cli_test.ts:454`.

I updated docs accordingly:

- Added `-A` dev/source-run caveat + production least-privilege note in `README.md:11`.
- Added explicit `KATO_AUTO_INIT_ON_START=false` guidance in `README.md:40`.
- Clarified `export` is for the specified session id in `README.md:48`.
- Added the same `-A` caveat in the smoke runbook note in `dev-docs/notes/dev.testing.md:13`.

And I previously fixed the stale zod decision line in `dev-docs/notes/dev.decision-log.md:79`.
