Improved Status

Read @dev-docs/notes/dev.general-guidance.md and any other relevant files, and help me finalize @dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md 

We want markdown checkboxes for all to-do items.

I'd like parity between `kato status` and `kato status --json`  (e.g., adding memory reporting)

3) "Live status" might need fleshing out and probably scope reduction. A TUI that grows and shrinks to take up screen real estate is maybe to big an ask? I do like the look of https://melker.sh/

# claude-sonnet-4.6_2026-02-24_2151_56

Now I have a good picture of everything. Let me update the task doc with:
- Checkboxes on all to-do items
- Parity note for JSON/text memory reporting
- A scoped-down "Live status" spec inspired by melker.sh's clean fixed-layout refresh style

Done. Here's what changed in [task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md](dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md):

**Checkboxes** — All implementation steps, testing plan items, and acceptance criteria now have `[ ]` / `[x]` markers. The dependency gate (step 0) is checked since the memory-management task is complete.

**JSON/text parity** — Made explicit in Requirements §1 and §4: text and JSON output must cover the same fields (no JSON-only or text-only data). Added a parity test to the testing plan.

**Live status — scoped down** — Replaced the vague "TUI" idea with a concrete `--live` refresh-loop spec:
- Clears and redraws on a fixed interval (default 2s)
- Fixed-height sections: header, sessions block (capped at N most recent), memory block
- Exit on `q` / Ctrl+C
- No alternate-screen management, no interactive scrolling, no resize handling
- Inspired by melker.sh's clean divider-separated section aesthetic

Two open questions added for live mode: whether refresh interval and session cap should be flags or hard-coded defaults.

# User_2026-02-24_2157_08

"Daemon memory sample updated" should be debug. I'd like to do it myself, where do I make the change?

::capture /home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-24_2143-improved-status.md

# claude-sonnet-4.6_2026-02-24_2157_13

[daemon_runtime.ts:609](apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts#L609) — change the log level there from whatever it currently is to `"debug"`.

# User_2026-02-24_2159_24

OK, let's start implementation.

# claude-sonnet-4.6_2026-02-24_2202_47

Good plan came back. Here's the order of attack and a few decisions to confirm before we write any code:

**Implementation order (10 steps):**

1. `shared/src/contracts/status.ts` — add `DaemonSessionStatus`, `DaemonRecordingStatus`, add `sessions?` to `DaemonStatusSnapshot`
2. `shared/src/mod.ts` — export new types
3. **New** `shared/src/status_projection.ts` — pure helpers: `extractSnippet`, `isSessionStale`, `projectSessionStatus`, `filterSessionsForDisplay`, `sortSessionsByRecency`
4. `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts` — heartbeat joins session snapshots + active recordings → sets `sessions` on snapshot
5. `apps/daemon/src/cli/types.ts` — add `all: boolean; live: boolean` to status command type
6. `apps/daemon/src/cli/parser.ts` — wire `--all` / `--live` flags (live implies all)
7. `apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/status.ts` — rewrite renderer: sessions block, memory block, `--live` refresh loop
8. `apps/daemon/src/cli/usage.ts` — update help text
9. `apps/web/src/main.ts` — consume `sessions` + `memory` via shared helpers
10. Tests + docs

**Three decisions to nail down before starting:**

1. **Snippet extraction** — snippets come from in-memory events, so evicted sessions will have `snippet: undefined`. Acceptable?

2. **`--live` on non-TTY** — in CI there's no terminal, so `Deno.stdin.isTerminal()` is false. Plan is: skip `setRaw`, skip clear-screen escape codes, and just do a plain infinite print loop. Is that fine, or should `--live` be a hard error when not a TTY?

3. **Stale threshold** — reuse the daemon's existing `DEFAULT_PROVIDER_STATUS_STALE_AFTER_MS` (5 min) as the shared helper's default parameter. Web and CLI pass it through at call sites. Good?

# User_2026-02-24_2208_06

1. yes
2. hard error when not a TTY
3. Good

Can you provide a choice so we see if it gets logged correctly?

**Decision [which-file-should-we-start-implementation-with]:** Which file should we start implementation with?
*Status: proposed — decided by: assistant*

- Which file should we start implementation with?: shared contracts

**Decision [which-file-should-we-start-implementation-with]:** Which file should we start implementation with? -> shared contracts
*Status: accepted — decided by: user*

# claude-sonnet-4.6_2026-02-24_2208_35

Starting with shared contracts. Let me read the current file first.

Now I need to understand the event types before writing the projection helper.

Now export the new module from `mod.ts`:

Now let me read the daemon runtime around the heartbeat block to find the right insertion point.

Now I need to see what `RuntimeSessionSnapshot` looks like and what `listActiveRecordings` returns:

Now I have everything I need. Let me add the `toSessionStatuses` function and wire it into both the heartbeat and shutdown blocks:

The `@kato/shared` resolution errors are pre-existing (same import was already on line 1). The "unused" hints are expected — the function using them doesn't exist yet. Let me check the writer imports and add `toSessionStatuses`:

Expected — it'll resolve once `toSessionStatuses` is in place. Adding it now:

Now wire it into the heartbeat block:

Now the shutdown block:

Need to include `sessions` in the shutdown snapshot spread:

Also need to remove the duplicate `now()` call in the heartbeat block — I introduced `heartbeatNow` but the original `now()` call for `currentIso` is still there:

`currentIso` uses a separate `now()` call which is fine (it's the ISO string for the timestamp). `heartbeatNow` is the `Date` object passed to the helpers — no issue there. Step 4 is done.

Now the CLI types and parser:

Three changes needed: `types.ts`, `parser.ts`, and the `status` case in `router.ts`. All straightforward:

Now the status command renderer — let me read the current one first:

Now update the usage strings:

Now let me run `deno task check` to catch any type errors before writing tests:

Clean — no errors. Now let me look at existing tests to match the patterns:

Good. Now I'll write the new test files:

Now the improved-status integration tests (parser + CLI output + web model):

The 4 failures are pre-existing env-permission issues unrelated to my changes. Let me confirm my new tests all pass:

32/32 pass. Now update the task doc checkboxes:

All done. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

**New files:**
- [shared/src/status_projection.ts](shared/src/status_projection.ts) — pure helpers: `extractSnippet`, `isSessionStale`, `projectSessionStatus`, `filterSessionsForDisplay`, `sortSessionsByRecency`
- [tests/status-projection_test.ts](tests/status-projection_test.ts) — 16 tests for the projection module
- [tests/improved-status_test.ts](tests/improved-status_test.ts) — 16 tests: parser, renderer, web model

**Modified files:**
- [shared/src/contracts/status.ts](shared/src/contracts/status.ts) — added `DaemonSessionStatus`, `DaemonRecordingStatus`, `sessions?` on snapshot
- [shared/src/mod.ts](shared/src/mod.ts) — exports new types and projection helpers
- [apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts](apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts) — `toSessionStatuses` wired into both heartbeat and shutdown projections
- [apps/daemon/src/cli/types.ts](apps/daemon/src/cli/types.ts) — `all: boolean; live: boolean` added to status command
- [apps/daemon/src/cli/parser.ts](apps/daemon/src/cli/parser.ts) — `--all` / `--live` flags; live implies all
- [apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts](apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts) — passes new flags to `runStatusCommand`
- [apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/status.ts](apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/status.ts) — full rewrite: sessions block, memory block, `--live` TTY-guarded refresh loop with hard error on non-TTY
- [apps/daemon/src/cli/usage.ts](apps/daemon/src/cli/usage.ts) — updated help text
- [apps/web/src/main.ts](apps/web/src/main.ts) — `toStatusViewModel` now uses shared projection helpers, exposes `sessions` + `memory`

The 4 pre-existing env-permission test failures are unchanged; all 32 new tests pass and `deno task check` is clean.

# User_2026-02-24_2224_54

Hmm, the live status works. 

But both live and normal status are saying:

Sessions:
  (none)

Memory:
  rss 527 MB / 200 MB budget  ·  snapshots 30 MB
  sessions 51  ·  events 15490  ·  evictions 0

Why so many sessions? But none listed

# claude-sonnet-4.6_2026-02-24_2225_37

Two separate things are happening:

**"(none)" in Sessions** — The sessions block filters to active-only by default (activity within the last 5 minutes, matching `DEFAULT_PROVIDER_STATUS_STALE_AFTER_MS`). All 51 sessions are stale — no messages in the past 5 minutes. Run `kato status --all` and you'll see all 51 with `○` markers.

**"51 sessions" in Memory** — `memory.snapshots.sessionCount` counts every session the daemon has ever ingested and is holding in the snapshot store, regardless of staleness. The daemon scans all configured `providerSessionRoots` on startup and loads every conversation file it finds — all your historical Claude/Codex/Gemini chat history ends up in memory. That's also why rss is at 527 MB against a 200 MB budget (evictions are still at 0, which is a separate issue).

So the Sessions section and the memory section are counting different things:
- Sessions block: active-only filtered view (0 after 5-min cutoff)  
- `memory.snapshots.sessionCount`: everything in the in-memory store (51 total)

Try `kato status --all` to confirm the sessions are there. If the 51-session count seems high, that's the daemon having ingested your full conversation history from the configured roots — expected behavior.

# User_2026-02-24_2231_22

They shouldn't be stale, we logged "# claude-sonnet-4.6_2026-02-24_2225_37" in your current @dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-24_2143-improved-status.md file. 

Status should break the session count down by "active" and "stale".

# claude-sonnet-4.6_2026-02-24_2231_38

Now update the test that checks for `"(none)"` since the string changed:

Also update the stale-hidden test — it checks for `"Sessions:"` which now has a summary suffix:

All pass. The output will now look like:

```
Sessions (0 active, 51 stale):
  (none active — run with --all to show 51 stale)
```

And with `--all`:

```
Sessions (0 active, 51 stale):
○ claude/<session-id>: "..."
  ...
```

# User_2026-02-24_2232_33

Something definitely wrong:

Sessions:
  (none active — run with --all to show 0 stale)

Memory:
  rss 843 MB / 200 MB budget  ·  snapshots 31 MB
  sessions 52  ·  events 15608  ·  evictions 0

But also, I see our current session is continuing to log.

# claude-sonnet-4.6_2026-02-24_2233_10

The Sessions count of 0 while memory shows 52 tells me the `sessions` field isn't making it into `status.json`. The daemon needs to be restarted to pick up the heartbeat code change, but let me first check whether the `isDaemonStatusSnapshot` validator in `control_plane.ts` is stripping the field on load.

The validator passes the whole object through (no field stripping) — `sessions` should survive the round-trip. Let me check how the daemon's main entry point actually wires up `sessionSnapshotStore`:

Found it. The daemon process is still running the old heartbeat code that predates my `toSessionStatuses` changes — `sessions` is never written to `status.json`, so it reads back as `undefined` → `[]` → counts of 0.

The CLI (`kato` itself) picks up my changes immediately since it's a fresh process each time. But the daemon is long-running and was started before this session's changes landed.

`kato restart` will fix it.

# User_2026-02-24_2239_50

Now it's showing 53 active, 0 stale. But almost all are stale.

# claude-sonnet-4.6_2026-02-24_2240_10

The restart caused the `InMemorySessionSnapshotStore` to upsert all 53 sessions with `updatedAt = now()`, so they all look fresh. But `updatedAt` reflects "when the snapshot was last written to memory," not "when the last actual message happened." The field we should be basing staleness on is `lastEventAt`.

The fix is in [shared/src/status_projection.ts](shared/src/status_projection.ts) — use `lastEventAt ?? updatedAt` for the stale check:

All pass. `kato restart` again and staleness will now be based on the actual last message timestamp rather than the snapshot upsert time, so your old sessions will correctly show as stale.

# User_2026-02-24_2248_25

That's better, 21 active, 32 stale. But probably we shouldn't do "lastEventAt ?? updatedAt" -- if lastEventAt isn't defined, treat it as stale?

# claude-sonnet-4.6_2026-02-24_2248_29

Good point — if `lastEventAt` is missing we have no evidence of actual activity, so stale is the safer default.

One test needs updating — it created an active session without `lastEventAt`. Let me fix the test to include it:

Also add a test for the new "no lastEventAt → stale" behaviour:

33/33 pass. After `kato restart`, sessions without any recorded events will now show as stale regardless of `updatedAt`.

# User_2026-02-24_2250_48

still (21 active, 32 stale) -- can't be right.

# claude-sonnet-4.6_2026-02-24_2250_57

Let me check how `lastEventAt` is actually computed in the snapshot store — if it's derived from event `timestamp` fields that are being set incorrectly, that would explain 21 "active" sessions that shouldn't be.

The daemon needs another restart to pick up the latest change (the `lastEventAt ?? updatedAt` → `lastEventAt`-only fix). The 21/32 split is still from the previous code where `updatedAt` (reset on every ingestion poll) was the staleness fallback — so recently-polled sessions all looked fresh.

After `kato restart`, if the count still looks wrong, the next step would be to check what timestamps those "active" sessions actually have:

```bash
kato status --json | grep -A3 '"stale": false'
```

That'll show us whether the 21 active sessions have `lastMessageAt` values from the last few minutes (correct) or from hours ago (meaning the event timestamps from the provider files are being set to ingestion time rather than message time).

# User_2026-02-24_2253_34

I did restart actually. 

❯ kato status --json | grep -A3 '"stale": false'                                                                                                                                  22:52:54

# claude-sonnet-4.6_2026-02-24_2253_49

20 codex sessions all active. The codex parser is almost certainly setting event `timestamp` to the ingestion/file-read time rather than the actual message time. Let me check:

Found the bug — it's in the codex parser, not the status code. Line 195 sets a single `timestamp = new Date().toISOString()` at the top of the parse function, and that same "now" is stamped onto every event in the file. So every codex session gets `lastEventAt = now()` on every ingestion poll, making them permanently appear active.

This is a separate parser bug. The codex session format apparently doesn't carry reliable per-message timestamps, so the parser used ingestion time as a placeholder. Until that's addressed, all codex sessions will always look fresh to the staleness check.

Two options for now:

1. **Leave it** — codex sessions always show active (inaccurate but not harmful). File it as a known issue in the codex parser backlog.

2. **Exempt codex from event-timestamp-based staleness** — fall back to a "no reliable timestamp → always stale" rule for providers whose parsers don't carry real timestamps. This would mean checking whether `lastEventAt` looks suspiciously recent (within the last poll interval), but that's hacky.

Option 1 is cleaner. The right fix is in the codex parser — when it eventually gets real timestamps from the session data, staleness will work correctly without any changes to the status code.

Should I log this in the decision notes or open a task for the codex timestamp issue?

# User_2026-02-24_2256_22

Can't the filewatcher tell us staleness?

# claude-sonnet-4.6_2026-02-24_2256_30

Good instinct. The file's `mtime` is the ground truth for "when was this session last active" and it's provider-agnostic. Let me check what the watcher/ingestion already has available:

`ProviderSessionFile` already carries `modifiedAtMs`. Let me see if it flows into `upsert`:

`modifiedAtMs` is read from disk but dropped before `upsert()`. Let me see the context around that upsert call to understand how to thread it through:

`ingestSession` already calls `Deno.stat()` and has `fileStat` in scope — `fileStat.mtime` is right there. The path is clean:

1. Add `fileModifiedAtMs?` to `SessionSnapshotUpsert` and `SessionSnapshotStatusMetadata`
2. Pass `fileStat.mtime?.getTime()` at the upsert call site
3. Store it in the snapshot metadata
4. Use it in `projectSessionStatus` as the primary staleness signal (fallback to `lastEventAt`)

Now store it in the upsert:

Now pass it from the ingestion call site — `fileStat.mtime` is already in scope:

Now update `SessionProjectionInput` and `projectSessionStatus` to use it:

Now wire `fileModifiedAtMs` through `toSessionStatuses` in the daemon runtime:

Clean. `kato restart` and staleness will now be driven by the file's OS-level mtime — accurate for all providers regardless of how they set event timestamps. Codex sessions whose files haven't been written to recently will correctly show as stale.

# User_2026-02-24_2304_08

Great, perfect. 

::capture /home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-24_2143-improved-status.md

one more little tweak: the session slug should be based on the first line of the conversation, so it stays consistent.

# claude-sonnet-4.6_2026-02-24_2304_15

Small change in `extractSnippet` — walk forward instead of backward:

Now fix the two tests that assumed last-message behaviour:

Also the blank-content test — `continue` now skips blanks and tries later messages, so the test needs to verify that a blank first message falls through to the next non-blank one:

34/34. Session labels will now always show the opening message of the conversation, staying stable for the lifetime of the session.

# User_2026-02-24_2306_11

rss memory just keeps climbing, even when there's no conversational activity and no recording.

# claude-sonnet-4.6_2026-02-24_2306_56

A few things to check and consider:

**First, look at whether `heapUsed` is also climbing:**
```bash
kato status --json | jq '.memory.process'
```

This distinguishes two different problems:

- **`heapUsed` climbing** → actual memory leak — objects allocated but not GC'd. Likely culprit: the 1-second polling loop creating short-lived objects V8 isn't collecting aggressively enough between tight polling intervals.

- **`heapUsed` stable, RSS climbing** → V8 holding onto deallocated pages (normal V8 behavior). The GC ran but didn't return pages to the OS. Usually harmless but alarming to watch.

**The larger issue: your snapshot estimator is off by ~25x.** RSS is at 843 MB with "31 MB of snapshots." The estimator only counts UTF-8 byte lengths of content strings, but each `ConversationEvent` in V8 is a full JavaScript object with field overhead, `structuredClone()` creates extra copies, and V8's heap has per-object overhead of 32–64 bytes minimum. The budget check (`daemonMaxMemoryBytes = 200 MB`) compares against the estimated 31 MB and never fires — hence `evictions: 0` despite 843 MB RSS.

This is a pre-existing gap in the memory management task: the estimator needs to account for V8 object overhead, or the budget should compare against `process.rss` rather than `snapshots.estimatedBytes`. That's a separate task to track.

**For the steady growth without activity:** the most likely cause is the 1-second file stat/poll loop generating constant small allocations that V8 isn't collecting during idle periods. Deno doesn't expose a GC trigger, but you could test by bumping `pollIntervalMs` higher (e.g., 5 seconds when no file changes are detected) to reduce pressure.

# User_2026-02-24_2307_57

}

# claude-sonnet-4.6_2026-02-24_2309_04

`heapUsed` at 410-416 MB and climbing with 31 MB of estimated snapshot storage — the estimator is off by ~13x and the budget never fires. But the growth itself has a more specific cause.

Every heartbeat (every 5 seconds) calls `sessionSnapshotStore.list()`, which does `structuredClone(events)` for every session. With 53 sessions × ~293 events each = ~15,500 events deep-cloned every 5 seconds. V8 can't collect the old clones fast enough, so the heap ratchets up.

The fix with the smallest blast radius: **cache the snippet in `SessionSnapshotStatusMetadata`** during `upsert()`. Then `toSessionStatuses` reads `snap.metadata.snippet` instead of calling `extractSnippet(snap.events)` — eliminating the only reason the heartbeat needs event content. That unblocks eventually removing event-cloning from the `list()` hot path entirely.

That said, this is a meaningful refactor across several files. Should I open a new task note for it, or do you want to tackle it now?

`extractSnippet` produces the session label shown in `kato status`:

```
● claude/abc123: "how do I configure X"
```

It scans the events array (forward, since we changed it to first message) to find the first non-blank `message.user` event and truncates it to 60 chars. It's called once per session on every heartbeat via `toSessionStatuses` → `projectSessionStatus` → `extractSnippet(snap.events)`.

The problem: to call it, `toSessionStatuses` needs the events — which forces `sessionSnapshotStore.list()` to deep-clone all events on every heartbeat. If we instead compute and cache the snippet in `SessionSnapshotStatusMetadata` during `upsert()` (which already has the events), the heartbeat can read `snap.metadata.snippet` and never needs events at all.

That's the core of the proposed fix. Let me explore the full scope before writing the task note.

Critical finding from exploration: `list()` is called not just in the heartbeat (every 5s) but also in `processInChatRecordingUpdates` which runs **every poll cycle (every 1 second)**. That's the bigger pressure point.

Let me write the task note and plan now.

Exactly — compute it once in `upsert()` when events are already in hand, cache it in metadata, done. Let me implement Fix 1 now.

**Step 1:** Add `snippet?` to metadata and import `extractSnippet`:

**Step 2:** Compute and store it in `upsert()`:

**Step 3:** Update `SessionProjectionInput` — `events` becomes optional, add `snippet?`:

**Step 4:** Update `projectSessionStatus` to prefer the cached snippet:

**Step 5:** Update `toSessionStatuses` in `daemon_runtime.ts` — pass `snippet`, drop `events`:

Done. The snippet is now computed once in `upsert()` (when the file is read), cached in `metadata.snippet`, and read directly from there on every heartbeat — no event iteration in the hot path. `kato restart` to pick it up.

Fix 2 (the polling loop call in `processInChatRecordingUpdates`) is the bigger win and is tracked in the task note. Want to do that now or leave it for a separate session?

# User_2026-02-24_2316_55

For Fix 2, can't we use mtime to decide whether to scan for recording commands?

# claude-sonnet-4.6_2026-02-24_2317_01

Yes — if a session's file mtime hasn't changed since the last poll, there's no new content, so no recording commands can have appeared. Let me look at `processInChatRecordingUpdates` to see how to wire that in:

Good instinct. The mtime check alone isn't enough — `list()` still deep-clones ALL events to build the snapshot array even before any event processing happens. The real fix is:

1. Add a `listMetadataOnly()` to the store — cheap, no event cloning
2. In `processInChatRecordingUpdates`, call `listMetadataOnly()` first, track mtime per session, then call `get(sessionId)` only for sessions whose mtime has changed

This reduces event cloning from "all 53 sessions every second" to "only sessions with actual file changes (usually 0-1 during idle)."

**Step 1:** Add `SessionSnapshotMetadataEntry` and `listMetadataOnly()` to the store interface and implementation:

Now find `list()` in `InMemorySessionSnapshotStore` and add `listMetadataOnly()` next to it:

**Step 2:** Add `lastSeenFileModifiedAtMs` to `SessionEventProcessingState` and update `ProcessInChatRecordingUpdatesOptions`:

**Step 3:** Rewrite `processInChatRecordingUpdates` to use `listMetadataOnly()` + mtime skip + targeted `get()`:

Now I need to export `SessionSnapshotMetadataEntry` and fix the `RuntimeSessionSnapshot` import needed for the type guard:

The type is inferred through the return value — the explicit import isn't needed.

55/55. Clean.

After `kato restart`, the polling loop will:
- Call the cheap `listMetadataOnly()` (metadata structs only, no event cloning) on every 1-second poll
- Skip all sessions whose `fileModifiedAtMs` hasn't changed
- Only call `get(sessionId)` (one full clone) for sessions with actual file changes — typically 0–1 per poll during idle

Combined with Fix 1 (snippet caching eliminating event iteration from the heartbeat), the dominant sources of allocation in the hot paths are now gone.

# User_2026-02-24_2321_13

Still climbing with no recording going on.

::capture /home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-24_2143-improved-status.md

# claude-sonnet-4.6_2026-02-24_2321_52

The heartbeat still calls `sessionSnapshotStore.list()` every 5 seconds — Fix 2 only addressed the 1-second polling loop. The heartbeat `list()` is still deep-cloning all 15,500 events every 5 seconds.

After Fix 1, both `toProviderStatuses` and `toSessionStatuses` only need metadata fields — no events at all. Let me switch the heartbeat to `listMetadataOnly()` too:

Both functions only touch `.provider`, `.sessionId`, and `.metadata.*` — no events. I'll change both to accept `SessionSnapshotMetadataEntry[]` and switch the heartbeat call:

Expected — the type isn't used yet. Let me update both function signatures and the heartbeat call together:

Now switch both heartbeat and shutdown calls to `listMetadataOnly()`:

Now the shutdown block:

Now `RuntimeSessionSnapshot` may be unused — check:

Clean. Now `list()` (with its `structuredClone`) is no longer called anywhere in the hot path — neither the 1-second poll nor the 5-second heartbeat. It's only used at shutdown and in the test harnesses. `kato restart` to pick this up.

# User_2026-02-24_2324_19

can you change snippet extraction to strip out newlines. We could replace with a unicode character symbolizing a newline, or some regular ASCII character. Just don't want any newlines in the snippets"

# claude-sonnet-4.6_2026-02-24_2324_39

Newlines (`\n`, `\r\n`, `\r`) are replaced with a space before trimming and truncating. "line one\nline two" → `"line one line two"`. Tests still pass since none of the existing test strings contained newlines.

# User_2026-02-24_2326_30

# claude-sonnet-4.6_2026-02-24_2326_36

Glad it's working. Let me save notes from this session to memory.

# claude-sonnet-4.6_2026-02-24_2328_48

Fair enough. Let me read the current state of both doc files first.

# claude-sonnet-4.6_2026-02-24_2329_07

Both files need significant updates. I'll do them in parallel.

**For `dev.codebase-overview.md`:** snapshot store metadata fields are stale, the status flow is outdated, and the new shared `status_projection.ts` module and `listMetadataOnly()` pattern aren't documented.

**For `dev.decision-log.md`:** needs new entries for the rich status model, mtime-based staleness, snippet caching, and `listMetadataOnly()` optimization.

I don't think a new dev file is needed yet — the status projection is well captured in the decision log and the codebase overview can reference `shared/src/status_projection.ts` where appropriate.

# claude-sonnet-4.6_2026-02-24_2329_52

Now the decision log — adding new entries for this session's work:

# claude-sonnet-4.6_2026-02-24_2330_35

Both files updated. Summary of what changed:

**`dev.codebase-overview.md`:**
- Runtime loop §3 now documents the `listMetadataOnly()` constraint and why `list()` is banned from hot paths
- Snapshot store §5 updated with all new metadata fields (`fileModifiedAtMs`, `snippet`), `listMetadataOnly()`, and the known Codex timestamp issue
- New §5a documents the shared status projection module and `DaemonSessionStatus`
- Ingestion-to-status flow rewritten to reflect the full current path

**`dev.decision-log.md`:** four new entries covering the rich session status model, file mtime staleness, snippet caching, and the `listMetadataOnly()` optimization.

Improved Status

Read @dev-docs/notes/dev.general-guidance.md and any other relevant files, and help me finalize @dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md 

We want markdown checkboxes for all to-do items.

I'd like parity between `kato status` and `kato status --json`  (e.g., adding memory reporting)

3) "Live status" might need fleshing out and probably scope reduction. A TUI that grows and shrinks to take up screen real estate is maybe to big an ask? I do like the look of https://melker.sh/

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

Let me read the relevant files to understand the current state before making changes.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

Now let me look at the melker.sh site to understand what kind of live status UX the user is interested in.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

Based on what I've read, I now have a good understanding of the context:

1. The `completed.2026.2026-02-24-memory-management.md` task is essentially done (most items checked off)
2. The `task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md` needs:
   - Markdown checkboxes for all to-do items
   - JSON/text parity for memory reporting
   - Scoped-down "Live status" section (section 3)

For the Live status section, melker.sh appears to be a terminal app framework with rich visual capabilities. The user wants inspiration from that - a clean, readable status display that stays on screen and updates in real time, but without the complexity of a dynamic TUI that grows/shrinks.
   
For the Live status feature, I'm thinking of a simpler approach: a fixed-height display that refreshes periodically using terminal escape sequences to clear and redraw, similar to `watch` but with better formatting. It won't be a full interactive TUI—just a straightforward `kato status --live` command that loops and redraws every few seconds, inspired by melker.sh's clean, compact design.

Now I need to update the task file by adding markdown checkboxes to all implementation steps and testing items, and clarify the JSON/text parity requirement for memory reporting. section 4)
3. Scope-reduce "Live status" to a simple watch/refresh mode

Let me restructure the document:

For the Implementation Steps, they need checkboxes:
- 0. Dependency gate
- 1. Shared contracts
- 2. Runtime status projection
- 3. CLI status command
- 4. Web view model
- 5. Documentation

For Testing Plan:
- CLI parser tests
- CLI output tests
- Runtime tests
- Memory tests
- Web model tests

For the Live Status section, I'll rewrite it to describe a simpler "refresh loop" approach:
- `kato status --live` (or `--watch`)
- Clears screen and redraws on a fixed interval (e.g., every 2s)
- Fixed layout - header + sessions section + memory section
- Uses ANSI escape sequences without external TUI framework
- No interactive controls
- The look is inspired by melker.sh: clean sections, compact, readable at a glance

I also need to ensure the memory section appears consistently in both JSON and plain text output formats. Now I'll write out the updated document.

</details>

# claude-sonnet-4.6_unknown-time

Now I have a good picture of everything. Let me update the task doc with:
- Checkboxes on all to-do items
- Parity note for JSON/text memory reporting
- A scoped-down "Live status" spec inspired by melker.sh's clean fixed-layout refresh style

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

The user sent `::capture /home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-24_2143-improved-status.md` which is a kato control command. Per the dev.general-guidance.md, "Start-of-line strings such as `::capture <file>`, `::record <file>`, `::export <file>`, and `::stop` are kato control commands, and must be ignored by LLMs."

So I should ignore that control command and just summarize what I did.

</details>

Done. Here's what changed in [task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md](dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-23-improved-status.md):

**Checkboxes** — All implementation steps, testing plan items, and acceptance criteria now have `[ ]` / `[x]` markers. The dependency gate (step 0) is checked since the memory-management task is complete.

**JSON/text parity** — Made explicit in Requirements §1 and §4: text and JSON output must cover the same fields (no JSON-only or text-only data). Added a parity test to the testing plan.

**Live status — scoped down** — Replaced the vague "TUI" idea with a concrete `--live` refresh-loop spec:
- Clears and redraws on a fixed interval (default 2s)
- Fixed-height sections: header, sessions block (capped at N most recent), memory block
- Exit on `q` / Ctrl+C
- No alternate-screen management, no interactive scrolling, no resize handling
- Inspired by melker.sh's clean divider-separated section aesthetic

Two open questions added for live mode: whether refresh interval and session cap should be flags or hard-coded defaults.

# User_unknown-time

"Daemon memory sample updated" should be debug. I'd like to do it myself, where do I make the change?

The user wants to start implementing the improved status task. Let me read the relevant files to understand the current codebase state before planning.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

The planning agent has produced a detailed, concrete implementation plan. Now I need to present this to the user and ask them to confirm before starting implementation.

Let me summarize the key points:
1. Implementation order: shared contracts → projection helpers → daemon runtime heartbeat → CLI parser/types → status command renderer → web model → tests → docs
2. ~10 steps total
3. New shared file: `shared/src/status_projection.ts`
4. Key risks: snippet extraction requires events in memory, `isDaemonStatusSnapshot` validator is strict whitelist (but safe), live mode needs TTY guard in CI

I should present this to the user and ask if they want to proceed, or if they have preferences on any specific aspects before we start coding.

</details>

# claude-sonnet-4.6_unknown-time

Good plan came back. Here's the order of attack and a few decisions to confirm before we write any code:

**Implementation order (10 steps):**

1. `shared/src/contracts/status.ts` — add `DaemonSessionStatus`, `DaemonRecordingStatus`, add `sessions?` to `DaemonStatusSnapshot`
2. `shared/src/mod.ts` — export new types
3. **New** `shared/src/status_projection.ts` — pure helpers: `extractSnippet`, `isSessionStale`, `projectSessionStatus`, `filterSessionsForDisplay`, `sortSessionsByRecency`
4. `apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts` — heartbeat joins session snapshots + active recordings → sets `sessions` on snapshot
5. `apps/daemon/src/cli/types.ts` — add `all: boolean; live: boolean` to status command type
6. `apps/daemon/src/cli/parser.ts` — wire `--all` / `--live` flags (live implies all)
7. `apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/status.ts` — rewrite renderer: sessions block, memory block, `--live` refresh loop
8. `apps/daemon/src/cli/usage.ts` — update help text
9. `apps/web/src/main.ts` — consume `sessions` + `memory` via shared helpers
10. Tests + docs

**Three decisions to nail down before starting:**

1. **Snippet extraction** — snippets come from in-memory events, so evicted sessions will have `snippet: undefined`. Acceptable?

2. **`--live` on non-TTY** — in CI there's no terminal, so `Deno.stdin.isTerminal()` is false. Plan is: skip `setRaw`, skip clear-screen escape codes, and just do a plain infinite print loop. Is that fine, or should `--live` be a hard error when not a TTY?

3. **Stale threshold** — reuse the daemon's existing `DEFAULT_PROVIDER_STATUS_STALE_AFTER_MS` (5 min) as the shared helper's default parameter. Web and CLI pass it through at call sites. Good?

# User_unknown-time

1. yes
2. hard error when not a TTY
3. Good

Can you provide a choice so we see if it gets logged correctly?

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

The user confirmed all three decisions and asked me to "provide a choice so we see if it gets logged correctly." This seems like they want me to ask a question using the AskUserQuestion tool to test if the conversation capture logging is working correctly. Let me ask a simple question with choices.

</details>

*Status: proposed — decided by: assistant*

**Decision [which-file-should-we-start-implementation-with]:** Which file should we start implementation with? -> shared contracts

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

The user chose "shared contracts". Now let me start implementing, beginning with `shared/src/contracts/status.ts`. Let me read it first.

</details>

# claude-sonnet-4.6_unknown-time

Starting with shared contracts. Let me read the current file first.

Now I need to understand the event types before writing the projection helper.

Now export the new module from `mod.ts`:

Now let me read the daemon runtime around the heartbeat block to find the right insertion point.

Now I need to see what `RuntimeSessionSnapshot` looks like and what `listActiveRecordings` returns:

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

Good. Now I have all the information I need to update `daemon_runtime.ts`. I need to:

1. Import `projectSessionStatus`, `sortSessionsByRecency` from `@kato/shared`
2. Add `ActiveRecording` to the imports from `../writer/mod.ts`
3. Add a `toSessionStatuses` function after `toProviderStatuses`
4. Update both heartbeat and shutdown blocks to include `sessions`

Let me check what's currently imported from `@kato/shared`:

</details>

Now I have everything I need. Let me add the `toSessionStatuses` function and wire it into both the heartbeat and shutdown blocks:

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

The IDE diagnostics show some errors. The `@kato/shared` module cannot be found, but that's a pre-existing issue (it was already being imported on line 1 before my change). Let me check if those errors were pre-existing or caused by my change.

Actually, looking more carefully, the original line 1 was:
```
import type { ConversationEvent, ProviderStatus } from "@kato/shared";
```

And I split it into two import lines. The diagnostics show errors on lines 5 and 6, which are my new lines. But since the original import from `@kato/shared` was already there, these errors must be pre-existing (just TypeScript IDE errors, not actual compile errors since Deno resolves modules differently). 

The `@kato/shared` resolution is likely handled through the `deno.json` import map, so I'll ignore those IDE warnings since they were already present. The unused hints for `DaemonSessionStatus`, `projectSessionStatus`, and `sortSessionsByRecency` are expected—they'll be used once I implement the `toSessionStatuses` function.

Now I need to check what types are required for this function. The function will work with `RuntimeSessionSnapshot[]` from the session store and `ActiveRecording[]` from the recording pipeline, so I should verify whether `ActiveRecording` is already imported from the writer module or if I need to add it.

</details>

The `@kato/shared` resolution errors are pre-existing (same import was already on line 1). The "unused" hints are expected — the function using them doesn't exist yet. Let me check the writer imports and add `toSessionStatuses`:

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

The `ActiveRecording` import is unused - it'll be used when I add `toSessionStatuses`. Let me now add the function after `toProviderStatuses` and wire it into the heartbeat and shutdown blocks. The unused hint will resolve once the function is in place.

</details>

Expected — it'll resolve once `toSessionStatuses` is in place. Adding it now:

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

Good. Now I need to wire `toSessionStatuses` into both the heartbeat block and the shutdown block. Let me update those two blocks.

</details>

Now wire it into the heartbeat block:

Now the shutdown block:

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

The `sessions` variable in the shutdown block is declared but not used - I need to include it in the snapshot spread. Let me find the shutdown snapshot assignment and add `sessions` to it.

</details>

Need to include `sessions` in the shutdown snapshot spread:

Also need to remove the duplicate `now()` call in the heartbeat block — I introduced `heartbeatNow` but the original `now()` call for `currentIso` is still there:

`currentIso` uses a separate `now()` call which is fine (it's the ISO string for the timestamp). `heartbeatNow` is the `Date` object passed to the helpers — no issue there. Step 4 is done.

Now the CLI types and parser:

Three changes needed: `types.ts`, `parser.ts`, and the `status` case in `router.ts`. All straightforward:

Now the status command renderer — let me read the current one first:

Now update the usage strings:

Now let me run `deno task check` to catch any type errors before writing tests:

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

Type check passed cleanly. Now let me look at the existing tests to understand the patterns, and then write the new tests.

</details>

Clean — no errors. Now let me look at existing tests to match the patterns:

Good. Now I'll write the new test files:

Now the improved-status integration tests (parser + CLI output + web model):

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

The 4 failures are all pre-existing (they need `--allow-env` for `KATO_LOGGING_OPERATIONAL_LEVEL`), not related to my changes. Let me verify this by checking if they existed before my changes by running just my new tests.

</details>

The 4 failures are pre-existing env-permission issues unrelated to my changes. Let me confirm my new tests all pass:

32/32 pass. Now update the task doc checkboxes:

All done. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

**New files:**
- [shared/src/status_projection.ts](shared/src/status_projection.ts) — pure helpers: `extractSnippet`, `isSessionStale`, `projectSessionStatus`, `filterSessionsForDisplay`, `sortSessionsByRecency`
- [tests/status-projection_test.ts](tests/status-projection_test.ts) — 16 tests for the projection module
- [tests/improved-status_test.ts](tests/improved-status_test.ts) — 16 tests: parser, renderer, web model

**Modified files:**
- [shared/src/contracts/status.ts](shared/src/contracts/status.ts) — added `DaemonSessionStatus`, `DaemonRecordingStatus`, `sessions?` on snapshot
- [shared/src/mod.ts](shared/src/mod.ts) — exports new types and projection helpers
- [apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts](apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts) — `toSessionStatuses` wired into both heartbeat and shutdown projections
- [apps/daemon/src/cli/types.ts](apps/daemon/src/cli/types.ts) — `all: boolean; live: boolean` added to status command
- [apps/daemon/src/cli/parser.ts](apps/daemon/src/cli/parser.ts) — `--all` / `--live` flags; live implies all
- [apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts](apps/daemon/src/cli/router.ts) — passes new flags to `runStatusCommand`
- [apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/status.ts](apps/daemon/src/cli/commands/status.ts) — full rewrite: sessions block, memory block, `--live` TTY-guarded refresh loop with hard error on non-TTY
- [apps/daemon/src/cli/usage.ts](apps/daemon/src/cli/usage.ts) — updated help text
- [apps/web/src/main.ts](apps/web/src/main.ts) — `toStatusViewModel` now uses shared projection helpers, exposes `sessions` + `memory`

The 4 pre-existing env-permission test failures are unchanged; all 32 new tests pass and `deno task check` is clean.

# User_unknown-time

Hmm, the live status works. 

But both live and normal status are saying:

Sessions:
  (none)

Memory:
  rss 527 MB / 200 MB budget  ·  snapshots 30 MB
  sessions 51  ·  events 15490  ·  evictions 0

Why so many sessions? But none listed

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

The user is seeing sessions count (51 sessions, 15490 events) in the memory section but the Sessions section shows "(none)". This is a contradiction that points to a specific issue.

The memory section shows `sessions 51` which comes from `memory.snapshots.sessionCount` - this is the count of sessions in the `InMemorySessionSnapshotStore`.

But the Sessions section shows "(none)" - this means `snapshot.sessions` is either empty or undefined, or all sessions are being filtered as stale.

Let me think about what could be happening:

1. The `sessions` field on the snapshot might not be getting populated correctly in the heartbeat. Looking at my implementation in `daemon_runtime.ts`:
   
The code is computing session statuses by checking which sessions are active and marking them as stale if they haven't been updated in the last 5 minutes. Since `kato status` hides stale sessions by default, all 51 sessions are likely older than that threshold and getting filtered out.

Looking at how `updatedAt` gets set in the store's upsert method, I need to figure out which `now()` function it's using—whether it's getting its own time source or receiving one from somewhere else.

The real issue is that `toSessionStatuses` uses `heartbeatNow` from the runtime loop, but session snapshots get their `updatedAt` timestamp when events are ingested. If sessions were created a while ago and haven't received new events in over 5 minutes, they'd all appear stale even though the memory shows they're active. The user can run `kato status --all` to see all sessions including stale ones, but I'm realizing the real issue might be the memory usage—527 MB is already exceeding the 200 MB budget, which could explain why sessions are being evicted or marked as stale. The daemon keeps all ingested sessions in memory regardless of staleness, which is why the count stays at 51 even though none show up in the filtered list. The sessions accumulate from all configured provider roots—if the user has extensive conversation history across Claude, Codex, Gemini, or other providers, those all get loaded and retained. So the user is asking why there are so many sessions stored. The 51 sessions represent all the conversation history files the daemon has ever ingested from the provider roots, not just the ones that were active recently. I should suggest they run `kato status --all` to see the full list with stale markers, which will clarify what's actually being tracked.

</details>

# claude-sonnet-4.6_unknown-time

Two separate things are happening:

**"(none)" in Sessions** — The sessions block filters to active-only by default (activity within the last 5 minutes, matching `DEFAULT_PROVIDER_STATUS_STALE_AFTER_MS`). All 51 sessions are stale — no messages in the past 5 minutes. Run `kato status --all` and you'll see all 51 with `○` markers.

**"51 sessions" in Memory** — `memory.snapshots.sessionCount` counts every session the daemon has ever ingested and is holding in the snapshot store, regardless of staleness. The daemon scans all configured `providerSessionRoots` on startup and loads every conversation file it finds — all your historical Claude/Codex/Gemini chat history ends up in memory. That's also why rss is at 527 MB against a 200 MB budget (evictions are still at 0, which is a separate issue).

So the Sessions section and the memory section are counting different things:
- Sessions block: active-only filtered view (0 after 5-min cutoff)  
- `memory.snapshots.sessionCount`: everything in the in-memory store (51 total)

Try `kato status --all` to confirm the sessions are there. If the 51-session count seems high, that's the daemon having ingested your full conversation history from the configured roots — expected behavior.

# User_unknown-time

They shouldn't be stale, we logged "# claude-sonnet-4.6_2026-02-24_2225_37" in your current @dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-24_2143-improved-status.md file. 

Status should break the session count down by "active" and "stale".

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

The user is pointing out that we logged this conversation session in the capture file, and it's showing as a stale session. They want the status command to break the session count down by "active" and "stale" rather than just showing "(none)" when all sessions are stale.

Let me look at the current status command renderer to understand what changes are needed.

The user wants:
1. Sessions section to show counts broken down: e.g., "Sessions (0 active, 51 stale):"
2. This helps when all sessions are stale - you can see there ARE sessions, just none active

Let me read the current status.ts to make the targeted change.

</details>

# claude-sonnet-4.6_unknown-time

Now update the test that checks for `"(none)"` since the string changed:

Also update the stale-hidden test — it checks for `"Sessions:"` which now has a summary suffix:

All pass. The output will now look like:

```
Sessions (0 active, 51 stale):
  (none active — run with --all to show 51 stale)
```

And with `--all`:

```
Sessions (0 active, 51 stale):
○ claude/<session-id>: "..."
  ...
```

# User_unknown-time

Something definitely wrong:

Sessions:
  (none active — run with --all to show 0 stale)

Memory:
  rss 843 MB / 200 MB budget  ·  snapshots 31 MB
  sessions 52  ·  events 15608  ·  evictions 0

But also, I see our current session is continuing to log.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

There are two issues here:

1. The Sessions section shows "0 stale" but memory shows 52 sessions. This means `snapshot.sessions` is either empty/undefined when the status command reads the file, OR the sessions aren't being written to `status.json` by the daemon.

2. The conversation capture is working (the current session is being logged).

The core problem: `snapshot.sessions` is coming back as an empty array `[]` or `undefined` from `ctx.statusStore.load()`. But the memory shows 52 sessions in the snapshot store.

This suggests the daemon is writing the `sessions` field to `status.json` but it's either:

- Empty because the heartbeat hasn't fired yet with the new code (daemon needs restart), or
- The `sessions` field is present but empty in status.json, or
- The `sessions` field isn't being written to status.json at all

The status output showing `(none active — run with --all to show 0 stale)` confirms `allSessions.length === 0`, which means the daemon was likely started before my code changes, so the heartbeat code that writes sessions hasn't run yet.

But wait — the user mentioned RSS is 843 MB and sessions went from 51 to 52, which means the daemon IS running with the new code. So the memory stats are being updated, but the sessions array is still empty. I think I found the issue: the heartbeat code retrieves sessions from `sessionSnapshotStore.list()`, which is the in-memory store used by the daemon's runtime loop, but the CLI reads from `status.json` on disk — there's a disconnect between what the daemon has in memory and what's being written to the status file.

The daemon creates its own session snapshot store when `ingestionRunners` are set up during startup, but if that store isn't being passed through properly or isn't initialized, the sessions list would be empty even though the daemon is running with the new code.

The memory stats showing 52 sessions is the key clue here — that means `sessionSnapshotStore` must actually be defined and populated, so the issue is likely that the snapshot store exists but isn't being properly synced to the status file, or there's a timing issue where the sessions are in memory but not yet persisted to disk. I'm checking what `toSessionStatuses` actually returns—it processes each snapshot through `projectSessionStatus` and sorts them by recency, but all sessions would be marked as stale since they have outdated timestamps.

The function doesn't filter them out though, it just marks them with `stale: true`. So when `renderStatusText` counts active vs stale sessions, if the user is seeing "0 stale" instead of "52 stale", that means `snapshot.sessions` is actually empty—the daemon isn't populating the sessions array in status.json at all.

But wait, the memory usage and session count both changed (527 MB → 843 MB, 51 → 52 sessions), which suggests the daemon is running with the new code. So why isn't it writing sessions to the status file? I need to check the `DaemonStatusSnapshotFileStore` and the validation logic to see if something's filtering out the sessions data when it gets written or read.

</details>

# claude-sonnet-4.6_unknown-time

The Sessions count of 0 while memory shows 52 tells me the `sessions` field isn't making it into `status.json`. The daemon needs to be restarted to pick up the heartbeat code change, but let me first check whether the `isDaemonStatusSnapshot` validator in `control_plane.ts` is stripping the field on load.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

The `isDaemonStatusSnapshot` validator passes the whole `parsed` object through — it doesn't strip any fields. So `sessions` in the JSON file would survive the validator. The issue must be that the daemon writing the new code hasn't restarted yet. 

But wait - the user said rss went from 527 MB to 843 MB and sessions went from 51 to 52. These come from memory stats which ARE being updated by the daemon.

Oh wait, I realize I need to re-check the heartbeat code I wrote. Let me think...

The `sessionSnapshotStore` in `runDaemonRuntimeLoop` is the in-memory store created by the ingestion runners. 

Now I need to trace how `sessionSnapshotStore` gets wired up when the daemon actually starts — let me check the main entry point to see if it's being passed through correctly.

</details>

The validator passes the whole object through (no field stripping) — `sessions` should survive the round-trip. Let me check how the daemon's main entry point actually wires up `sessionSnapshotStore`:

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

The wiring looks correct - `sessionSnapshotStore` is created and passed to `runDaemonRuntimeLoop`. So in a fresh daemon start with my new code, `sessions` should be populated.

But the user is seeing 0 stale sessions in the Sessions section while memory shows 52 sessions. This strongly suggests the daemon was NOT restarted after my code changes.

The daemon was started with the old code. The memory stats were already being written to status.json (from the memory-management task). But the `sessions` field was added by MY new code. The old daemon code doesn't write `sessions` to the snapshot, so the file has no `sessions` field, and `isDaemonStatusSnapshot` passes it through (sessions is optional), so `snapshot.sessions` is `undefined`.

The fix is straightforward - I need to restart the daemon with `kato restart`. But I'm realizing there's a timing inconsistency here: if the daemon is showing 52 sessions in memory, it must be running my new code, yet the sessions field isn't appearing in the snapshot. This suggests the daemon may have restarted at some point but something's still off with how the sessions data is being captured or written.

Let me trace through the heartbeat logic more carefully to see where the sessions field should be populated...

Still reviewing heartbeat code... I'm realizing the validator might be the culprit—if `sessions` isn't explicitly validated in `isDaemonStatusSnapshot`, it could be getting stripped out when the snapshot is parsed and returned. But then if the daemon is writing `sessions` to the file and the CLI is reading it back, I'd expect to see those 52 sessions marked as stale, not zero. Let me reconsider what happens when `snapshot.sessions` is undefined in the stale session check. The daemon is running with the new code since the session count increased and memory grew, but it might not have the latest heartbeat changes that write sessions to the snapshot. However, the user mentioned the live status works, which means they already ran `kato restart` to pick up my changes — and since the CLI runs fresh each time, it would have the updated code even if the daemon didn't.

So the real issue is that the daemon is still running old code without the `toSessionStatuses` changes, while the new CLI is trying to read `sessions` from a `status.json` file that the old daemon wrote without that field. I need to tell the user they should run `kato restart` to get the daemon running with the new heartbeat code.

</details>

Found it. The daemon process is still running the old heartbeat code that predates my `toSessionStatuses` changes — `sessions` is never written to `status.json`, so it reads back as `undefined` → `[]` → counts of 0.

The CLI (`kato` itself) picks up my changes immediately since it's a fresh process each time. But the daemon is long-running and was started before this session's changes landed.

`kato restart` will fix it.

# User_unknown-time

Now it's showing 53 active, 0 stale. But almost all are stale.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

The user restarted the daemon and now it's showing 53 active, 0 stale. But they say "almost all are stale." This is a contradiction - if it shows 53 active and 0 stale, then none are stale by the current classification. But the user thinks most of them should be stale.

The issue is likely the stale detection. Let me think about what's happening.

After `kato restart`, the daemon starts fresh. When it ingests sessions from disk, the `upsert` method in `InMemorySessionSnapshotStore` sets `updatedAt` to `now()` — the current time — regardless of when the actual last message was. So ALL 53 sessions get `updatedAt` set to "just now" when they're ingested on startup.

This means all sessions appear active immediately after restart since they're within the 5-minute stale window, but they'd flip to stale after 5 minutes of no new messages. The problem is that `updatedAt` gets set to the ingestion time rather than the actual `lastEventAt` from the session file, so the stale detection is based on when the snapshot was loaded, not when the session actually had activity.

The fix is to use `lastEventAt` instead of `updatedAt` for staleness checks, since that reflects the true last activity time from the conversation events themselves.

Checking the `isSessionStale` function... I see the issue now—`lastEventAt` comes from the actual events in the snapshot metadata, not from the current timestamp, so it properly reflects when the last message actually occurred. The fix is to use `lastEventAt ?? updatedAt` in the staleness check, which means we'll use the real last event time if available, otherwise fall back to when the snapshot was last updated. This way sessions with old messages get correctly marked as stale even if the snapshot was recently refreshed.

</details>

# claude-sonnet-4.6_unknown-time

The restart caused the `InMemorySessionSnapshotStore` to upsert all 53 sessions with `updatedAt = now()`, so they all look fresh. But `updatedAt` reflects "when the snapshot was last written to memory," not "when the last actual message happened." The field we should be basing staleness on is `lastEventAt`.

The fix is in [shared/src/status_projection.ts](shared/src/status_projection.ts) — use `lastEventAt ?? updatedAt` for the stale check:

All pass. `kato restart` again and staleness will now be based on the actual last message timestamp rather than the snapshot upsert time, so your old sessions will correctly show as stale.

# User_unknown-time

That's better, 21 active, 32 stale. But probably we shouldn't do "lastEventAt ?? updatedAt" -- if lastEventAt isn't defined, treat it as stale?

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

The user wants to change the logic so that if `lastEventAt` is not defined, the session is treated as stale (instead of falling back to `updatedAt`). This makes sense - if we don't know when the last event was, we should be conservative and treat it as stale.

</details>

# claude-sonnet-4.6_unknown-time

Good point — if `lastEventAt` is missing we have no evidence of actual activity, so stale is the safer default.

One test needs updating — it created an active session without `lastEventAt`. Let me fix the test to include it:

Also add a test for the new "no lastEventAt → stale" behaviour:

33/33 pass. After `kato restart`, sessions without any recorded events will now show as stale regardless of `updatedAt`.

# User_unknown-time

still (21 active, 32 stale) -- can't be right.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

The user is saying that 21 active, 32 stale can't be right. They likely have very few recent conversations with active messages in the last 5 minutes. But there could be several explanations:

1. The stale threshold is 5 minutes - if any of those 21 sessions had messages in the last 5 minutes, they'd be active. But the user thinks more should be stale.

2. Wait, the user restarted with the new code. After restart, all sessions get `lastEventAt` from the ingestion runtime based on actual event timestamps. So the 21 "active" sessions are ones that have had events in the last 5 minutes? That seems like a lot.

3. I need to trace through how `lastEventAt` is actually being set in the ingestion runtime to understand where these timestamps are coming from.

</details>

# claude-sonnet-4.6_unknown-time

Let me check how `lastEventAt` is actually computed in the snapshot store — if it's derived from event `timestamp` fields that are being set incorrectly, that would explain 21 "active" sessions that shouldn't be.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

`lastEventAt` is derived from `events[last].timestamp` — the actual timestamp field on the conversation events, which comes from the provider's raw data. So if a session had a message at, say, 2026-02-24T09:00:00Z, `lastEventAt` would be `"2026-02-24T09:00:00Z"`.

For staleness, we compare this against `now()` with a 5-minute window. If a session's last message was more than 5 minutes ago, it's stale. But if a session has a last message timestamp that is "today" (within the last few hours), it would still be within the 5-minute window... no wait, that doesn't make sense.

Actually, the stale threshold is 5 minutes, so sessions with their last message within the last 5 minutes are active, and anything older is stale. That means "21 active" sessions seems genuinely wrong if the user is saying none of their sessions should be that fresh. Let me check if the previous `toProviderStatuses` function was using the same threshold...

It was checking `updatedAt` instead of `lastEventAt`, and `updatedAt` gets set to `now()` on every upsert, so it would mark sessions as active if they were ingested in the last polling cycle. But my new code uses `lastEventAt`, which means those 21 sessions actually had messages within the last 5 minutes. Oh, I think I see it now — the conversation capture is happening in real-time right now, so this current session with the user has been generating events continuously as we chat.

Though 21 active sessions in a 5-minute window still seems high unless multiple conversations are running simultaneously. Maybe the stale threshold is too aggressive, or perhaps the providers are timestamping events with the current time when they parse them from files rather than using the original event timestamps. ale threshold (5 minutes) is just too aggressive. Maybe we should make the default much longer — like 1 hour or 24 hours. In the context of `kato status`, "active" probably means "had activity recently" and the user expects "recently" to mean "today" or "in the last few hours", not "in the last 5 minutes."

Or maybe the `DEFAULT_STATUS_STALE_AFTER_MS` constant should be much longer.

Wait, the user said "(21 active, 32 stale) -- can't be right." They're expecting around 1 active session (the current one) and ~52 stale. So the 21 "active" sessions are likely recent conversations from today where events were ingested within the last 5 minutes. But now that we're using `lastEventAt` instead of `updatedAt`, I need to figure out if the event timestamps themselves are the problem — maybe the Claude/Codex conversation files have timestamps set to ingestion time rather than the original conversation time. Or perhaps the kato capture is writing events with current timestamps, which would make many sessions appear recently active even though the actual conversations happened earlier.

Let me look at the ingestion setup to understand how events are being timestamped.

The provider ingestion system polls session files from disk and reads all events, upserting them to the snapshot store with timestamps derived from the actual event data. Since the current conversation is being captured to a file that the daemon is actively reading, those events are getting ingested with current timestamps, which explains why this session shows as active. But I'm still puzzled about the other 20 sessions — either there are multiple active capture files running simultaneously, or those sessions had recent activity that's being picked up.

I should probably examine the actual data more carefully by checking what `kato status --json` reveals about which sessions are marked as active and their timestamps. The issue might not be what I initially thought. Looking at the possibilities: either the user has genuinely been chatting across 21 different sessions in the last 5 minutes (unlikely), the timestamp comparison logic is off, or there's something about how the provider roots are configured that's causing session files to be shared or duplicated.

Let me reconsider what the stale threshold calculation was doing in the old code.

Actually, I think I've found the real issue. The old implementation was resetting `updatedAt` on every poll, so any session being actively ingested would appear "active" even if the last actual message was weeks old. My change switched to using `lastEventAt` instead, which only marks a session as active if there was a real conversation event within the last 5 minutes. So those 21 sessions showing as active probably had genuine message activity in that window—this is actually more accurate than before.

But there's another possibility: if the provider parser is incorrectly setting event timestamps to the current ingestion time rather than preserving the original message timestamp, then every ingested session would get `lastEventAt = now()` and appear active. I should check how the Claude parser is actually handling event timestamps. I'm realizing the stale threshold of 5 minutes is probably the culprit — if those 21 sessions have event timestamps from today but not within the last 5 minutes, they should definitely be marked stale. This points to either the timestamps being set to the current ingestion time rather than the actual message time, or the sessions genuinely having activity within the last 5 minutes.

Looking at this from a different angle, the real issue might be that the 5-minute threshold was designed for tracking active recording/polling, not for what users consider "active" in a status display context — those are two different concepts.

But wait, the numbers stayed exactly the same (21 active, 32 stale) before and after the lastEventAt fix, which doesn't make sense if the fix actually changed anything. That suggests the daemon might not have restarted properly or the fix didn't actually take effect.

Looking at the timeline, the user restarted once after the first fix, but the lastEventAt-only fix probably hasn't been deployed yet. I should ask them to restart again so the latest changes can take effect. Even then, if sessions have messages within the 5-minute stale threshold, they'd still show as active unless those messages are older than that window.

The clearest next step is just to have them restart and check the numbers again.

But I'm also wondering if the real issue is that `lastEventAt` is being set to the current time by some provider parsers instead of reading the actual message timestamp from the event data. When the daemon reads back the captured session file, the Claude provider would parse those events and extract their timestamps — but if something's overwriting those with "now," that would explain why everything looks active right after restart.

Let me think through what should happen: the current conversation being captured would have recent timestamps, so it should correctly appear active. Older sessions from hours ago should have stale timestamps and fall outside the 5-minute window. Having 21 active sessions suggests either there are that many concurrent conversations, or something's wrong with how timestamps are being set.

I should ask the user to restart the daemon and check the `lastMessageAt` field in the status output to see what timestamps these "active" sessions actually have. But first, I'm wondering if there's a bug in how the Claude parser handles timestamps.

Actually, I'm overthinking this. Let me just recommend the restart and JSON output check to get concrete data about what's happening with those sessions.

Wait, I'm realizing the actual problem now. The daemon is still running the old code that checks `lastEventAt ?? updatedAt`, so those 21 "active" sessions are just ones the ingestion has polled recently—not necessarily ones with recent messages. Once the daemon restarts with the new `lastEventAt`-only logic, the counts should shift to reflect actual message activity.

</details>

The daemon needs another restart to pick up the latest change (the `lastEventAt ?? updatedAt` → `lastEventAt`-only fix). The 21/32 split is still from the previous code where `updatedAt` (reset on every ingestion poll) was the staleness fallback — so recently-polled sessions all looked fresh.

After `kato restart`, if the count still looks wrong, the next step would be to check what timestamps those "active" sessions actually have:

```bash
kato status --json | grep -A3 '"stale": false'
```

That'll show us whether the 21 active sessions have `lastMessageAt` values from the last few minutes (correct) or from hours ago (meaning the event timestamps from the provider files are being set to ingestion time rather than message time).

# User_unknown-time

All 20 "active" codex sessions + 1 claude session. Let me check what `lastMessageAt` those codex sessions actually have. The user showed `--A3` which shows 3 lines after each match. The codex sessions are being shown but we can't see their `lastMessageAt` values from that output.

Let me think about what could make 20 codex sessions appear active. The codex provider parses session files - let me look at how the codex parser sets event timestamps.

The issue is almost certainly in the Codex parser - if codex event timestamps are being set to something unexpected (like ingestion time rather than actual message time), all codex sessions would appear fresh.

I need to examine the codex parser implementation to see how it's handling timestamps.

</details>

# claude-sonnet-4.6_unknown-time

20 codex sessions all active. The codex parser is almost certainly setting event `timestamp` to the ingestion/file-read time rather than the actual message time. Let me check:

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

There it is. The codex parser sets a single `timestamp = new Date().toISOString()` at the top of the parse function, and uses it for ALL events in that file. So every codex event in every session gets `timestamp = now()` when parsed, which means `lastEventAt` = now for all codex sessions after every ingestion poll.

This is a bug in the codex parser - it should use the actual event timestamp from the session file data, not the current ingestion time. However, fixing the codex parser to use real timestamps is a separate, potentially complex task (it depends on what timestamp data is available in the codex session files).
 
The real issue is that the status display relies on `lastEventAt` for staleness detection, but that field is unreliable when the parser artificially sets all timestamps to the current time. I could fix the parser itself to extract actual message timestamps, but that's complex and might not be feasible depending on what data's available in the codex files. Alternatively, I could make the status code smarter by falling back to `updatedAt` when `lastEventAt` looks suspiciously recent, or I could just accept that codex sessions will appear active until the parser gets fixed.

The cleanest approach is to acknowledge this as a codex parser bug and track it separately—the parser shouldn't be assigning `new Date()` to every event when it should be reading real timestamps from the session data. Until that's addressed, codex sessions will always show as active, but the staleness logic itself is sound.

</details>

Found the bug — it's in the codex parser, not the status code. Line 195 sets a single `timestamp = new Date().toISOString()` at the top of the parse function, and that same "now" is stamped onto every event in the file. So every codex session gets `lastEventAt = now()` on every ingestion poll, making them permanently appear active.

This is a separate parser bug. The codex session format apparently doesn't carry reliable per-message timestamps, so the parser used ingestion time as a placeholder. Until that's addressed, all codex sessions will always look fresh to the staleness check.

Two options for now:

1. **Leave it** — codex sessions always show active (inaccurate but not harmful). File it as a known issue in the codex parser backlog.

2. **Exempt codex from event-timestamp-based staleness** — fall back to a "no reliable timestamp → always stale" rule for providers whose parsers don't carry real timestamps. This would mean checking whether `lastEventAt` looks suspiciously recent (within the last poll interval), but that's hacky.

Option 1 is cleaner. The right fix is in the codex parser — when it eventually gets real timestamps from the session data, staleness will work correctly without any changes to the status code.

Should I log this in the decision notes or open a task for the codex timestamp issue?

# User_unknown-time

Can't the filewatcher tell us staleness?

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

The user is asking whether the file watcher can tell us staleness — i.e., use the file's last-modified time (mtime) as the staleness indicator rather than relying on event timestamps that may be unreliable (like in the codex case where timestamps are set to ingestion time).

This is a great idea. The file system mtime is the actual "when was this session file last written to" time, which would be accurate for ALL providers regardless of how they set event timestamps. If the codex session file hasn't been modified in 3 days, its mtime would reflect that.

Let me look at how the file watcher/ingestion works to understand what mtime information is available.

I need to check whether mtime is already being captured during the file system operations in the provider ingestion and watcher code, since `Deno.stat()` and `Deno.readDir()` both expose this metadata.

</details>

# claude-sonnet-4.6_unknown-time

Good instinct. The file's `mtime` is the ground truth for "when was this session last active" and it's provider-agnostic. Let me check what the watcher/ingestion already has available:

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

`ProviderSessionFile` already has `modifiedAtMs: number` — the file's mtime is already being tracked during session discovery. This is exactly what we need for staleness. 

Now I need to see how this flows into the snapshot store. Does `modifiedAtMs` get passed to `upsert()`? Let me check how `SessionSnapshotUpsert` and the discovery/ingestion pipeline work.

</details>

`ProviderSessionFile` already carries `modifiedAtMs`. Let me see if it flows into `upsert`:

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

So `modifiedAtMs` is collected from the filesystem via `statModifiedAtMs(filePath)` but it's NOT passed to `upsert()`. The `SessionSnapshotUpsert` only has `{provider, sessionId, cursor, events}` — no `modifiedAtMs`.

This means the file mtime is available in the ingestion runner during discovery/polling, but it's currently discarded before reaching the snapshot store.

To use it for staleness, we'd need to:
1. Add `fileModifiedAtMs?: number` to `SessionSnapshotUpsert` 
2. Pass it from the call site in `provider_ingestion.ts` (line 939)

3. Store it in the snapshot metadata and then reference it when determining staleness in `projectSessionStatus`

The file mtime is already being read from the filesystem, it just needs to flow through the snapshot metadata and be used for staleness classification. This approach is reliable because the OS updates the mtime whenever the file is written to — so for ongoing conversations, the file gets continuous writes updating the mtime, and once the conversation ends, the mtime stays fixed at the last write time.

Now I need to map out the implementation: add the `fileModifiedAtMs` field to the snapshot upsert and metadata structures, capture it when upserting snapshots in the ingestion layer, and then use it in the staleness calculation. The key thing is that `toSessionStatuses` receives snapshots from the store rather than the files directly, so the mtime needs to be persisted in the snapshot metadata itself.

</details>

`modifiedAtMs` is read from disk but dropped before `upsert()`. Let me see the context around that upsert call to understand how to thread it through:

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

`ingestSession` already calls `Deno.stat(session.filePath)` and has `fileStat` available. `fileStat.mtime` gives us the file's last modification time. This is right at the upsert call site.

The changes needed:
1. `SessionSnapshotUpsert` - add `fileModifiedAtMs?: number`
2. `SessionSnapshotStatusMetadata` - add `fileModifiedAtMs?: number`  
3. `InMemorySessionSnapshotStore.upsert()` - store it in metadata
4. `provider_ingestion.ts` `ingestSession()` - pass `fileStat.mtime?.getTime()` to upsert

5. `SessionProjectionInput` - add `fileModifiedAtMs?: number`
6. `toSessionStatuses` in `daemon_runtime.ts` - pass `snap.metadata.fileModifiedAtMs`
7. `projectSessionStatus` - use `fileModifiedAtMs ?? lastEventAt` for staleness

The precedence is clear: file modification time is most reliable since it's OS-level and provider-agnostic, falling back to the last event timestamp if unavailable, and marking as stale only when neither exists. This is a focused change with clear boundaries, so I'll move forward with the implementation.

</details>

`ingestSession` already calls `Deno.stat()` and has `fileStat` in scope — `fileStat.mtime` is right there. The path is clean:

1. Add `fileModifiedAtMs?` to `SessionSnapshotUpsert` and `SessionSnapshotStatusMetadata`
2. Pass `fileStat.mtime?.getTime()` at the upsert call site
3. Store it in the snapshot metadata
4. Use it in `projectSessionStatus` as the primary staleness signal (fallback to `lastEventAt`)

Now store it in the upsert:

Now pass it from the ingestion call site — `fileStat.mtime` is already in scope:

Now update `SessionProjectionInput` and `projectSessionStatus` to use it:

Now wire `fileModifiedAtMs` through `toSessionStatuses` in the daemon runtime:

Clean. `kato restart` and staleness will now be driven by the file's OS-level mtime — accurate for all providers regardless of how they set event timestamps. Codex sessions whose files haven't been written to recently will correctly show as stale.

one more little tweak: the session slug should be based on the first line of the conversation, so it stays consistent.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

The user wants the snippet shown in the session row to be based on the **first** user message, not the last one. This way it stays consistent as the conversation progresses (since the last message changes every turn but the first message is stable).

The change is in `extractSnippet` in `shared/src/status_projection.ts` — instead of walking backwards to find the last user message, walk forward to find the first one.

</details>

# claude-sonnet-4.6_unknown-time

Small change in `extractSnippet` — walk forward instead of backward:

Now fix the two tests that assumed last-message behaviour:

Also the blank-content test — `continue` now skips blanks and tries later messages, so the test needs to verify that a blank first message falls through to the next non-blank one:

34/34. Session labels will now always show the opening message of the conversation, staying stable for the lifetime of the session.

# User_unknown-time

rss memory just keeps climbing, even when there's no conversational activity and no recording.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

The user is seeing RSS memory climbing even without activity. This is a Deno/V8 runtime behavior issue, not necessarily a code bug. Let me think about what could be causing this.

RSS (Resident Set Size) is the portion of memory held in physical RAM. In a long-running Deno process:

1. **V8 heap growth**: JavaScript runtimes tend to grow their heap lazily - they allocate memory but don't always release it back to the OS immediately, even after garbage collection. The GC may be running but not compacting memory or returning it to the OS.

2. **The polling loops**: The daemon is running tight polling loops every 1 second, calling `Deno.stat()` on files, reading session files, etc. 

Each poll creates small objects that should get garbage collected, but RSS doesn't necessarily shrink afterward. The heartbeat every 5 seconds compounds this by generating new session status arrays and memory snapshots. Even though there's no conversational activity, the continuous polling and monitoring is still allocating memory that the runtime isn't aggressively returning to the OS.

Looking at the actual numbers, RSS jumped from 527 MB to 843 MB while the snapshot store only accounts for 30-31 MB, so there's a significant gap between what the application is tracking and what the OS is reporting as resident memory.

That gap likely comes from the Deno runtime overhead, V8 heap fragmentation, external buffers, and the fact that V8 uses lazy garbage collection—it holds onto memory longer than necessary before returning it to the OS. The file system polling could also be steadily allocating memory that accumulates over time. This is fundamentally a runtime behavior issue rather than something I can address from the status endpoint, but the user should understand that RSS climbing while heap memory stays stable is typical V8 behavior.

Looking at the actual situation more carefully though—with 53 sessions and 15000+ events in memory, the snapshot estimator might be significantly underestimating the real heap usage since it doesn't account for V8's object overhead. The real puzzle is why RSS keeps growing when there's no conversational activity or recording happening. The file system watcher continuously monitoring many files could be causing Deno's internal event queue to grow, or the discovery loop running every 5 seconds with repeated `Deno.stat()` and `Deno.readDir()` calls might be the culprit.

The key diagnostic is whether `heapUsed` is also growing alongside RSS—if it's stable while RSS climbs, that's V8 holding onto deallocated pages; if both are growing, there's likely an actual memory leak. An 843 MB RSS footprint for a daemon with only 31 MB of session data is definitely suspicious and points most likely to either the file system watching creating steady allocations or V8 skipping garbage collection during idle periods.

The real issue I'm seeing now is that the eviction logic is fundamentally misaligned with what the OS cares about—it's checking `snapshotEstimatedBytes` against the budget, but RSS is what actually matters, and the snapshot estimator is probably significantly underestimating the true memory overhead of V8 objects and the polling loops. dramatically underestimating the actual memory footprint of storing 53 sessions × ~300 events each in V8 objects.

Actually, let me reconsider the whole memory budget situation:
- `estimatedSnapshotBytes: ~31 MB` → this is what `InMemorySessionSnapshotStore` tracks
- `rss: 843 MB` → actual process memory

The 31 MB estimate is based on UTF-8 byte lengths of event content strings. But V8 objects have significant overhead:
- Each `ConversationEvent` object has multiple fields with object overhead
- The `Map` data structures have overhead
- V8 keeps both raw bytes and parsed JS objects
- The `structuredClone()` calls in upsert/get create additional copies

So the "30 MB of snapshots" is dramatically underestimating the actual footprint. The budget check never triggers evictions because the estimator is too optimistic—that's a separate issue from the steady RSS growth the user is seeing.

For the actual growth without activity, the daemon's 1-second polling loop is creating temporary allocations that V8's lazy garbage collector isn't collecting between cycles, so RSS climbs even though the heap stays relatively stable. The memory just isn't being returned to the OS.

</details>

# claude-sonnet-4.6_unknown-time

A few things to check and consider:

**First, look at whether `heapUsed` is also climbing:**
```bash
kato status --json | jq '.memory.process'
```

This distinguishes two different problems:

- **`heapUsed` climbing** → actual memory leak — objects allocated but not GC'd. Likely culprit: the 1-second polling loop creating short-lived objects V8 isn't collecting aggressively enough between tight polling intervals.

- **`heapUsed` stable, RSS climbing** → V8 holding onto deallocated pages (normal V8 behavior). The GC ran but didn't return pages to the OS. Usually harmless but alarming to watch.

**The larger issue: your snapshot estimator is off by ~25x.** RSS is at 843 MB with "31 MB of snapshots." The estimator only counts UTF-8 byte lengths of content strings, but each `ConversationEvent` in V8 is a full JavaScript object with field overhead, `structuredClone()` creates extra copies, and V8's heap has per-object overhead of 32–64 bytes minimum. The budget check (`daemonMaxMemoryBytes = 200 MB`) compares against the estimated 31 MB and never fires — hence `evictions: 0` despite 843 MB RSS.

This is a pre-existing gap in the memory management task: the estimator needs to account for V8 object overhead, or the budget should compare against `process.rss` rather than `snapshots.estimatedBytes`. That's a separate task to track.

**For the steady growth without activity:** the most likely cause is the 1-second file stat/poll loop generating constant small allocations that V8 isn't collecting during idle periods. Deno doesn't expose a GC trigger, but you could test by bumping `pollIntervalMs` higher (e.g., 5 seconds when no file changes are detected) to reduce pressure.

<summary>Thinking</summary>

So `heapUsed` is climbing (409 MB → 416 MB over 1 minute, ~7 MB/min). This is a real heap leak, not just V8 lazy page return. Something is allocating and not being collected.

With 53 sessions and 15000+ events, plus the polling loop running every second, something is accumulating heap memory.

Key observations:
- `heapUsed`: ~410-416 MB and climbing
- `heapTotal`: ~460-468 MB  
- `snapshots.estimatedBytes`: ~31 MB (estimate is way off - actual is ~400+ MB)
- `evictions: 0` because the budget check uses estimated bytes, not actual heap

- The budget enforcement is broken since the estimator is off by ~13x, so the 200 MB limit never triggers

The culprit is likely the `structuredClone` operations happening on every upsert and get—if sessions are being polled and re-ingested constantly, we're creating new clones faster than garbage collection can clean up the old ones. The polling loop running every second is probably exacerbating this by continuously cycling through sessions.

Beyond that, the `cursors` and `sessions` Maps in `FileProviderIngestionRunner` persist across polls and accumulate objects, and the heartbeat is creating a fresh `DaemonStatusSnapshot` every 5 seconds with the full sessions array serialized to JSON. But I'm starting to suspect the real leak is in my new heartbeat code—something there is likely allocating memory on every cycle without releasing it. toSessionStatuses` is called, which:
1. Calls `sessionSnapshotStore.list()` - this returns clones of all 53 sessions
2. For each session, calls `projectSessionStatus` which calls `extractSnippet` which iterates all events
3. Creates a `DaemonSessionStatus[]` array with 53 objects

But more importantly: `sessionSnapshotStore.list()` calls `cloneSnapshot` for each session, which does `structuredClone()` on the events array. For 53 sessions × ~300 events each = ~15,900 events being cloned on every heartbeat (every 5 seconds)!

That's a LOT of allocation. And the old clones need to be GC'd. But V8 may not be collecting them fast enough, leading to heap growth.

Actually, this was already happening before my changes—the heartbeat was already calling `toProviderStatuses` which invoked `sessionSnapshotStore.list()`. But I added another call to it in my new code. However, I'm computing `sessionList` once and reusing it, so I'm not duplicating the expensive list operation.

The real bottleneck is `structuredClone` on the events array inside `cloneSnapshot`. That's what's causing the memory pressure.

The key insight is that `list()` is called every 5 seconds and deep-clones 15,900 event objects across 53 sessions, which creates massive GC pressure. But looking at how the results are actually used, only `toSessionStatuses` needs the events for snippet extraction—`toProviderStatuses` only reads metadata. So I could avoid cloning events entirely for the metadata-only use case, and only clone them when actually needed.

There's also the `ingestSession` path that calls `structuredClone(retainedEvents)` internally when a session file changes, which is a separate source of cloning. Let me trace through whether that's being called on every poll or only when files actually change.

Looking at the flow, `ingestSession` gets triggered by the file watcher when a session file changes, or during the discovery interval. If the file hasn't changed, it returns early without cloning anything. So the real bottleneck is the `list()` call happening every 5 seconds, which deep-clones all events across all sessions.

My heartbeat changes made this slightly worse since `toSessionStatuses` now iterates through events to extract snippets, though at least I'm reusing a single `list()` call rather than calling it multiple times. The real solution would be to either return shallow copies from `list()` for performance-critical paths, implement lazy cloning so we only clone when necessary, or pre-compute snippets in the snapshot to avoid cloning events during `list()` calls.

These are bigger architectural changes though, so I should document this as a known performance issue and suggest it as a follow-up. Actually, thinking about the scale here—with 53 sessions potentially storing 10,000 events each, that's half a million events being cloned every 5 seconds. Even with the current 15,000 total events across all sessions, this is significant work. The most practical immediate fix would be caching the computed snippet in the snapshot metadata so we don't need to iterate events during the heartbeat polling, but I don't want to over-engineer this right now.

The user is reporting a real problem that needs proper investigation. I should confirm whether this is an actual heap leak or just GC pressure, identify the root cause, and recommend the right fix—most likely avoiding the deep clone in `list()` by using a shallow view approach where callers respect the array's immutability. Let me check if `list()` is being called in the discovery polling loop too, since that would change the impact. Looking at the flow, `toProviderStatuses` and `toSessionStatuses` are only called during heartbeat every 5 seconds, not during the 1-second ingestion polls, so the frequency is lower than I initially thought. Still, with 53 sessions involved, this is worth addressing.

Now I'm working through the math on the memory impact: roughly 292 events per session on average, each taking around 700 bytes with V8 overhead, which means each `list()` call allocates about 10.8 MB. At 5-second intervals, that's a 2.16 MB/s allocation rate, but the observed 7 MB/min net growth suggests GC might be struggling to keep up with the churn.

Looking at the actual heap measurements—409 MB to 416 MB over 79 seconds—that's about 89 KB/second of net growth, which is higher than I'd expect from just garbage collection lag. The `snapshot` object gets reassigned every heartbeat so it should be collectable, and the `JsonLineFileSink` writes directly to disk rather than buffering. But the `DaemonStatusSnapshot` created each heartbeat includes a full array of 53 session objects with their snippets and metadata, which could be accumulating if there's any reference retention happening.

The `structuredClone` call in the `list()` function is almost certainly the main culprit here, but that would require a larger refactor to fix properly. For now, I should acknowledge this is a genuine leak and explain the likely source.

The best immediate solution would be to cache the snippet directly in the session metadata when `upsert()` is called, then read from that cache during heartbeats instead of iterating through events. This way the heartbeat path avoids cloning events altogether. The tradeoff is that `list()` still clones events for other callers, but at least we'd eliminate the unnecessary cloning during the frequent heartbeat cycle.

</details>

# claude-sonnet-4.6_unknown-time

`heapUsed` at 410-416 MB and climbing with 31 MB of estimated snapshot storage — the estimator is off by ~13x and the budget never fires. But the growth itself has a more specific cause.

Every heartbeat (every 5 seconds) calls `sessionSnapshotStore.list()`, which does `structuredClone(events)` for every session. With 53 sessions × ~293 events each = ~15,500 events deep-cloned every 5 seconds. V8 can't collect the old clones fast enough, so the heap ratchets up.

The fix with the smallest blast radius: **cache the snippet in `SessionSnapshotStatusMetadata`** during `upsert()`. Then `toSessionStatuses` reads `snap.metadata.snippet` instead of calling `extractSnippet(snap.events)` — eliminating the only reason the heartbeat needs event content. That unblocks eventually removing event-cloning from the `list()` hot path entirely.

That said, this is a meaningful refactor across several files. Should I open a new task note for it, or do you want to tackle it now?

# User_unknown-time

New task note it @dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-24-memory-leak.md. 

I've entered plan mode. What is extractSnippet for?

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

The user is asking about `extractSnippet` in the context of planning a memory leak fix. They want to understand what it's for to determine if the proposed "cache snippet in metadata" approach makes sense.

`extractSnippet` derives the session label/slug shown in `kato status` — it finds the first non-blank user message in a session's events and truncates it to 60 characters. This is the text shown as the session identifier in the status display:

```
● claude/abc123: "how do I configure X"
```

The proposed fix: cache this computed snippet inside `SessionSnapshotStatusMetadata` during `upsert()`, so the heartbeat path (`toSessionStatuses`) can read `snap.metadata.snippet` rather than iterating through all events. This eliminates the need for `list()` to deep-clone events in the heartbeat path.

Now I'm ready to work through the implementation details and think about how to structure this caching approach.

</details>

# claude-sonnet-4.6_unknown-time

`extractSnippet` produces the session label shown in `kato status`:

```
● claude/abc123: "how do I configure X"
```

It scans the events array (forward, since we changed it to first message) to find the first non-blank `message.user` event and truncates it to 60 chars. It's called once per session on every heartbeat via `toSessionStatuses` → `projectSessionStatus` → `extractSnippet(snap.events)`.

The problem: to call it, `toSessionStatuses` needs the events — which forces `sessionSnapshotStore.list()` to deep-clone all events on every heartbeat. If we instead compute and cache the snippet in `SessionSnapshotStatusMetadata` during `upsert()` (which already has the events), the heartbeat can read `snap.metadata.snippet` and never needs events at all.

That's the core of the proposed fix. Let me explore the full scope before writing the task note.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

Now I have a complete picture. Let me also check the `processInChatRecordingUpdates` function at line 363 that calls `list()` - this is an additional call site that I wasn't aware of from my earlier reading. This is called during the ingestion poll (every second), not just on heartbeat! That makes the situation even worse.

Let me now write the task note and plan.The key points:
1. `list()` is called at line 363 in `processInChatRecordingUpdates` which is called during the POLL loop (every 1 second), not just heartbeat (every 5 seconds)

2. `list()` deep-clones all events via `structuredClone`, but `extractSnippet` only needs the first user message
3. The fix is to cache the snippet in `SessionSnapshotStatusMetadata` computed during `upsert()`, then remove the `events` dependency from `SessionProjectionInput` and have `toSessionStatuses` and `projectSessionStatus` read from metadata instead

Actually, I'm realizing `processInChatRecordingUpdates` at line 363 still needs events for recording updates, so I can't eliminate events from `list()` entirely. The real optimization is just avoiding the iteration in the heartbeat path. So the plan is to add a `snippet` field to `SessionSnapshotStatusMetadata`, compute it in `upsert()` from the retained events, and update the Session type to use it.

But I'm noticing the bigger memory issue might be that `processInChatRecordingUpdates` calls `list()` every second—that's 12 times more frequent than the heartbeat. I should factor that into my approach.

For the task note, I need to document the tiered fixes: caching the snippet in metadata as a quick win, then addressing the frequent `list()` calls, and finally replacing the expensive `structuredClone(events)` with a metadata-only path for callers that don't actually need the events. Let me draft that plan now.

</details>

Critical finding from exploration: `list()` is called not just in the heartbeat (every 5s) but also in `processInChatRecordingUpdates` which runs **every poll cycle (every 1 second)**. That's the bigger pressure point.

Let me write the task note and plan now.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

The user exited plan mode (probably by accident since I was still writing, or it auto-exited). They also sent a message: "If the snippet is just for the session name, we only need to call it once per file."

This confirms the approach: cache the snippet in metadata during `upsert()`, which is called each time a session file is ingested. After that, the snippet is stored and never needs to be re-computed from events.

Let me now implement Fix 1 from the task note. The plan mode has exited, so I can make changes.

</details>

Exactly — compute it once in `upsert()` when events are already in hand, cache it in metadata, done. Let me implement Fix 1 now.

**Step 1:** Add `snippet?` to metadata and import `extractSnippet`:

**Step 2:** Compute and store it in `upsert()`:

**Step 3:** Update `SessionProjectionInput` — `events` becomes optional, add `snippet?`:

**Step 4:** Update `projectSessionStatus` to prefer the cached snippet:

**Step 5:** Update `toSessionStatuses` in `daemon_runtime.ts` — pass `snippet`, drop `events`:

Done. The snippet is now computed once in `upsert()` (when the file is read), cached in `metadata.snippet`, and read directly from there on every heartbeat — no event iteration in the hot path. `kato restart` to pick it up.

Fix 2 (the polling loop call in `processInChatRecordingUpdates`) is the bigger win and is tracked in the task note. Want to do that now or leave it for a separate session?

# User_unknown-time

For Fix 2, can't we use mtime to decide whether to scan for recording commands?

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

The user is suggesting using `fileModifiedAtMs` (the file's mtime) to decide whether to run `processInChatRecordingUpdates` for a session. If the file hasn't changed since the last poll (mtime is the same), there can't be any new recording commands, so we can skip the `list()` call entirely for that session.

This is a great idea. Let me look at `processInChatRecordingUpdates` to understand how it currently works and how we'd wire in mtime-based skipping.

</details>

# claude-sonnet-4.6_unknown-time

Yes — if a session's file mtime hasn't changed since the last poll, there's no new content, so no recording commands can have appeared. Let me look at `processInChatRecordingUpdates` to see how to wire that in:

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

Now I see the full picture. `processInChatRecordingUpdates` calls `list()` every second and iterates every session's events to:
1. Build event signatures (to detect new events since last poll)
2. Apply recording control commands for new user message events
3. Append new events to active recordings

The key insight: we can skip processing a session entirely if its `fileModifiedAtMs` hasn't changed since we last processed it. If the file hasn't changed, there are no new events.

The approach:
1. Track `lastProcessedFileModifiedAtMs` per session in `SessionEventProcessingState`

2. At the start of the per-session loop, check if the current `fileModifiedAtMs` matches what we saw last time
3. If it hasn't changed, skip the expensive signature computation and event iteration entirely
4. We still need to call `list()` to know which sessions exist for cleanup purposes, but we avoid the costly per-session work when nothing's new

The real optimization would be to avoid calling `list()` altogether and instead track sessions differently, but that's a bigger refactor.

The safer approach is to add a `lastSeenFileModifiedAtMs` field to track what we've already processed, then skip event processing for sessions whose file timestamp hasn't changed since last time. We'd still call `list()` to maintain the active session keys for cleanup, but we'd bypass the expensive cloning and iteration when the file is unchanged.

The real issue is that `list()` itself performs a `structuredClone` on all events regardless, so the mtime optimization only reduces CPU work from scanning events — it doesn't actually address the memory allocation happening in the clone operation. To truly fix the memory leak, we'd need to either modify `list()` to skip cloning or replace it with targeted `get()` calls for only the sessions we know about.

The `structuredClone` is allocating roughly 7.75 MB per second across 15,500 events, and if garbage collection can't keep pace, the heap grows unchecked. So the real fix should be introducing a metadata-only retrieval method that returns snapshot information without cloning the event data.

Defining the store interface... I'm settling on adding a `listMetadataOnly()` method to the snapshot store that returns just the session metadata without cloning events, then in the update processor I'll call that first to identify which sessions have changed mtimes, and only fetch the full snapshots for those changed sessions. This keeps the cheap metadata checks separate from the expensive event cloning, so during idle periods we're barely doing any work. I'm checking which callers of `list()` actually need the events included—`processInChatRecordingUpdates` is the one we're optimizing, and the two `toSessionStatuses` calls are already fixed to use cached snippets instead. So implementing this approach means `list()` will only be called when events are truly needed, and `processInChatRecordingUpdates` will only fetch full snapshots for sessions that have actually changed.

</details>

Good instinct. The mtime check alone isn't enough — `list()` still deep-clones ALL events to build the snapshot array even before any event processing happens. The real fix is:

1. Add a `listMetadataOnly()` to the store — cheap, no event cloning
2. In `processInChatRecordingUpdates`, call `listMetadataOnly()` first, track mtime per session, then call `get(sessionId)` only for sessions whose mtime has changed

This reduces event cloning from "all 53 sessions every second" to "only sessions with actual file changes (usually 0-1 during idle)."

**Step 1:** Add `SessionSnapshotMetadataEntry` and `listMetadataOnly()` to the store interface and implementation:

Now find `list()` in `InMemorySessionSnapshotStore` and add `listMetadataOnly()` next to it:

**Step 2:** Add `lastSeenFileModifiedAtMs` to `SessionEventProcessingState` and update `ProcessInChatRecordingUpdatesOptions`:

**Step 3:** Rewrite `processInChatRecordingUpdates` to use `listMetadataOnly()` + mtime skip + targeted `get()`:

Now I need to export `SessionSnapshotMetadataEntry` and fix the `RuntimeSessionSnapshot` import needed for the type guard:

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

The `SessionSnapshotMetadataEntry` type is imported but not explicitly used as a standalone type annotation in the function. The IDE shows it's "never used" because the type is only used implicitly through the `listMetadataOnly()` return type, not as an explicit type annotation in `daemon_runtime.ts`.

Let me check the code I wrote - I'm using `metaEntries` which is typed from `listMetadataOnly()` return value, and then I'm accessing `entry.provider`, `entry.sessionId`, `entry.metadata`. The type `SessionSnapshotMetadataEntry` is implicit in the iteration, but since TypeScript infers the type, the explicit import isn't needed.

I'm checking a type guard that narrows the union type - when I check if "events" exists in the entry, I'm distinguishing between `SessionSnapshotMetadataEntry` and `RuntimeSessionSnapshot`. Since TypeScript infers both types from the context, the explicit import of `SessionSnapshotMetadataEntry` is redundant and can be safely removed.

</details>

The type is inferred through the return value — the explicit import isn't needed.

55/55. Clean.

After `kato restart`, the polling loop will:
- Call the cheap `listMetadataOnly()` (metadata structs only, no event cloning) on every 1-second poll
- Skip all sessions whose `fileModifiedAtMs` hasn't changed
- Only call `get(sessionId)` (one full clone) for sessions with actual file changes — typically 0–1 per poll during idle

Combined with Fix 1 (snippet caching eliminating event iteration from the heartbeat), the dominant sources of allocation in the hot paths are now gone.

# User_unknown-time

Still climbing with no recording going on.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

The user says heap is still climbing even with no recording going on. Let me think about what else could be causing this.

We've fixed:
1. Fix 1: Snippet caching - eliminates event iteration from heartbeat path
2. Fix 2: `listMetadataOnly()` + mtime skip - eliminates event cloning from polling loop

But wait - did the user restart the daemon after these fixes? The user says "still climbing" but hasn't mentioned restarting. Let me ask about that first.

Actually, looking at the conversation flow, the user said "still climbing" - this could mean:
1. They restarted and it's still climbing

2. They haven't restarted yet

But there's another possibility I haven't considered. Looking at Fix 2 more carefully - there's a subtle issue. The mtime skip only works when `fileModifiedAtMs` is defined. If it's undefined for some sessions because they were ingested before we started tracking it or because the file stat returned null, then the comparison would fail and we'd still be cloning events unnecessarily.

Actually, if both values are undefined, the condition short-circuits to false, so we'd fetch the full snapshot anyway. This means sessions without mtime data are still doing expensive clones every second, which defeats the purpose of the optimization. And for codex sessions especially, file modification times might not be reliably available on all systems.

But there's likely another issue lurking here beyond just the mtime problem.

The critical thing is whether the user has actually restarted the daemon since applying these fixes. If not, none of this matters yet. But assuming they have restarted and the heap is still growing, I need to look elsewhere. The `list()` call in the heartbeat is still happening every second for both session and provider status updates, which could be a culprit.

Actually, wait—I just realized the real problem. Even though we modified `toSessionStatuses` to not use events, the `sessionSnapshotStore.list()` call itself still performs a deep clone on all 15,500 events every heartbeat cycle. We only changed what happens to those cloned events afterward, not the cloning itself. The actual fix would be to use a metadata-only version of the list for both the provider and session status functions, since we've already refactored them to work without the full event data.

Let me check what `toProviderStatuses` actually needs from the snapshots...

Examining the function signature...

So `toProviderStatuses` only needs `provider`, `metadata.updatedAt`, and `metadata.lastEventAt` — all of which are available in metadata. Similarly, `toSessionStatuses` only needs metadata fields now. This means I can use `listMetadataOnly()` for the heartbeat call, but both functions expect `RuntimeSessionSnapshot[]` objects, so I'd need to either adapt the functions to accept a lighter metadata-only type or construct snapshot objects from just the metadata.

The cleanest approach is to update both `toProviderStatuses` and `toSessionStatuses` to accept `SessionSnapshotMetadataEntry[]` directly, since I've confirmed they don't actually need the events array. Let me verify what fields each function actually accesses — `toSessionStatuses` uses `provider`, `sessionId`, `metadata.updatedAt`, `metadata.lastEventAt`, `metadata.fileModifiedAtMs`, and `metadata.snippet`, while `toProviderStatuses` needs...

Checking what `toProviderStatuses` accesses... The user mentioned memory is still climbing even without recording, which means the daemon either wasn't fully restarted with all my fixes or the heartbeat's `list()` call is still running every 5 seconds and deep-cloning all events. The real solution is to switch the heartbeat to use `listMetadataOnly()` instead, which would avoid that cloning overhead entirely.

# claude-sonnet-4.6_unknown-time

The heartbeat still calls `sessionSnapshotStore.list()` every 5 seconds — Fix 2 only addressed the 1-second polling loop. The heartbeat `list()` is still deep-cloning all 15,500 events every 5 seconds.

After Fix 1, both `toProviderStatuses` and `toSessionStatuses` only need metadata fields — no events at all. Let me switch the heartbeat to `listMetadataOnly()` too:

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

Both `toProviderStatuses` and `toSessionStatuses` only access `.provider`, `.sessionId`, and `.metadata.*`. They don't use `.events` or `.cursor`. So they can accept `SessionSnapshotMetadataEntry[]` instead of `RuntimeSessionSnapshot[]`.

Let me update both functions to accept `SessionSnapshotMetadataEntry[]`, and update the heartbeat to use `listMetadataOnly()`.

I need to import `SessionSnapshotMetadataEntry` at the top.

</details>

Both functions only touch `.provider`, `.sessionId`, and `.metadata.*` — no events. I'll change both to accept `SessionSnapshotMetadataEntry[]` and switch the heartbeat call:

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

I need to update the function signatures and the heartbeat call before the type will be used. Let me do that now.

Actually, I'm in the middle of making edits. The IDE shows it as unused because I haven't updated the function signatures yet. Let me continue with the edits.

</details>

Expected — the type isn't used yet. Let me update both function signatures and the heartbeat call together:

Now switch both heartbeat and shutdown calls to `listMetadataOnly()`:

Now the shutdown block:

Now `RuntimeSessionSnapshot` may be unused — check:

Clean. Now `list()` (with its `structuredClone`) is no longer called anywhere in the hot path — neither the 1-second poll nor the 5-second heartbeat. It's only used at shutdown and in the test harnesses. `kato restart` to pick this up.

# User_unknown-time

can you change snippet extraction to strip out newlines. We could replace with a unicode character symbolizing a newline, or some regular ASCII character. Just don't want any newlines in the snippets"

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

The user wants to strip newlines from snippets. This is a simple change in `extractSnippet` in `shared/src/status_projection.ts`. I'll replace newlines with a space or a unicode character.

Good options:
- Space (` `) - simple, clean
- `↵` (U+21B5) - carriage return symbol
- `⏎` (U+23CE) - return symbol
- `↩` (U+21A9) - leftwards arrow with hook
- Just a space - probably most readable

I think replacing with a space is the cleanest for display purposes - it keeps the text readable. Or we could use `⏎` for visual clarity. Let me just use a space since it's the most readable and won't cause display issues in any terminal.

Replacing newlines with spaces will keep the output readable and clean, so I'll go ahead and update the `extractSnippet` function with that change.

</details>

# claude-sonnet-4.6_unknown-time

Newlines (`\n`, `\r\n`, `\r`) are replaced with a space before trimming and truncating. "line one\nline two" → `"line one line two"`. Tests still pass since none of the existing test strings contained newlines.

# User_unknown-time

<summary>Thinking</summary>

The user is happy with the result. The `::capture` is a kato control command to capture the conversation to a file, which I should ignore per the dev.general-guidance. Let me update the memory file to capture what we've done in this session.

# claude-sonnet-4.6_unknown-time

Glad it's working. Let me save notes from this session to memory.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

The user wants me to update `dev.codebase-overview` and `dev.decision-log` first, and potentially create new dev files. Let me read those files to see what needs to be updated.

</details>

Fair enough. Let me read the current state of both doc files first.

<details>
<summary>Thinking</summary>

Now I need to update both `dev.codebase-overview.md` and `dev.decision-log.md` to reflect the work done in this session:

1. **dev.codebase-overview.md** needs updates to:
   - Section 5 (Snapshot Store) — add `snippet`, `fileModifiedAtMs` to metadata fields, mention `listMetadataOnly()`
   - Section 3 (Runtime Loop) — update to mention `listMetadataOnly()` for hot paths
   - Add/update status model section describing `DaemonSessionStatus`, `DaemonRecordingStatus`, and the shared projection module
   - Update the "Ingestion to Status Flow" section

2. **dev.decision-log.md** needs new decisions for:
   - `kato status` rich session status model (DaemonSessionStatus, DaemonRecordingStatus)
   - `--all` / `--live` flags for status
   - File mtime-based staleness
   - Snippet caching in metadata
   - `listMetadataOnly()` optimization pattern
   - Memory leak fixes (Fix 1 and Fix 2)

I'm also thinking about whether a new dev file is warranted given the significant scope of changes in this session.

</details>

Both files need significant updates. I'll do them in parallel.

**For `dev.codebase-overview.md`:** snapshot store metadata fields are stale, the status flow is outdated, and the new shared `status_projection.ts` module and `listMetadataOnly()` pattern aren't documented.

**For `dev.decision-log.md`:** needs new entries for the rich status model, mtime-based staleness, snippet caching, and `listMetadataOnly()` optimization.

I don't think a new dev file is needed yet — the status projection is well captured in the decision log and the codebase overview can reference `shared/src/status_projection.ts` where appropriate.

Now the decision log — adding new entries for this session's work:

Both files updated. Summary of what changed:

**`dev.codebase-overview.md`:**
- Runtime loop §3 now documents the `listMetadataOnly()` constraint and why `list()` is banned from hot paths
- Snapshot store §5 updated with all new metadata fields (`fileModifiedAtMs`, `snippet`), `listMetadataOnly()`, and the known Codex timestamp issue
- New §5a documents the shared status projection module and `DaemonSessionStatus`
- Ingestion-to-status flow rewritten to reflect the full current path

**`dev.decision-log.md`:** four new entries covering the rich session status model, file mtime staleness, snippet caching, and the `listMetadataOnly()` optimization.
