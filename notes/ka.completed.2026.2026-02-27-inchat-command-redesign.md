# In-Chat Recording Command Redesign (Primary Destination Model)

Historical/superseded note: this document predates the workspace-alias model.
Mentions of global `~/.kato/recordings` fallback are no longer current behavior.
Current behavior treats `~/.kato` as runtime/config/session state and writes
captured/exported conversation files to registered workspace roots.

## Summary
Replace overloaded `::record` semantics with a single-primary, no-UI model that is explicit about session state versus recording state.

1. Session owns a single `primaryRecordingDestination` pointer.
2. Reuse `recordings[]` as the destination registry: one stable `recordingId` per destination path.
3. Recording runtime state is either active or inactive for that session.
4. Add `::init [abs-path]` to set/prepare destination without starting.
5. Make `::record` argument-less and define it as start/resume at session primary destination.
6. Keep `::capture [abs-path]` as snapshot + activate, and make it set session primary destination.
7. Simplify `::stop` to argument-less only.
8. Keep global default fallback if session primary destination is unset.
9. Apply hard switch now, no compatibility aliases (`::start`, `::record <path>`, `::stop <arg>`).

## Goals
1. Remove ambiguity: after `::stop`, `::record` always resumes the session primary destination.
2. Preserve deterministic behavior in no-UI contexts.
3. Keep absolute-path-only policy for explicit path arguments.
4. Ensure outcomes remain inspectable in logs without UI feedback.
5. Support in-message command sequencing with command-level recording boundaries.
6. Make destination identity allocation idempotent: one `recordingId` per path.
7. Avoid parallel metadata maps when `recordings[]` can remain the single source of truth.

## Command Contract
1. Valid commands:
- `::init`: resolve destination as `primaryRecordingDestination` if set, otherwise global default; validate, prepare file if missing, ensure destination `recordingId`, do not start recording.
- `::init <abs-path>`: validate and prepare destination, set `primaryRecordingDestination`, ensure destination `recordingId`, do not start recording.
- `::record`: start/resume recording at `primaryRecordingDestination` if set, otherwise global default; ensure destination `recordingId` exists and reuse it.
- `::capture`: snapshot full conversation up to this command boundary into primary destination (or global default if unset), set pointer to resolved destination, ensure/reuse destination `recordingId`, activate recording there.
- `::capture <abs-path>`: snapshot full conversation up to this command boundary into path, set pointer to path, ensure/reuse destination `recordingId`, activate recording there.
- `::stop`: stop active recording only; preserve pointer.
- `::export <abs-path>`: export full conversation up to this command boundary; do not modify pointer or recording active state.
2. Invalid commands (parse error):
- `::start`
- `::record <anything>`
- `::stop <anything>`
3. Path argument policy:
- All explicit path arguments must be absolute.
- Relative paths, `@mentions`, and relative markdown-link targets are rejected.
4. Fallback policy:
- If pointer is unset and command needs destination, use global default root (`~/.kato/recordings/...`).

## Explicit State Machine
State is split into session state and recording state.

1. Session state:
- `primaryRecordingDestination`: `unset | set(absPath)`
- `recordings[]`: one entry per canonical destination path (stable `recordingId`, `desiredState`, `writeCursor`, `periods`)
2. Recording state:
- `activeRecording`: `off | on(absPath)`

Allowed composite states:
1. `S0`: pointer unset, active off.
2. `S1(P)`: pointer set to `P`, active off.
3. `S2(P)`: pointer set to `P`, active on `P`.

Transition rules:
1. `::init` with resolved destination `P`:
- `S0 -> S1(P)`
- `S1(Pold) -> S1(P)`
- `S2(Pold) -> S1(P)` (deactivate active `Pold`; no implicit append/flush; pointer moves to `P` only after successful init prep).
- `ensureRecordingEntry(P)` is idempotent (create only if missing, reuse existing recordingId when present).
2. `::record`:
- `S0 -> S2(G)` where `G` is generated global default and also persisted as pointer.
- `S1(P) -> S2(P)`
- `S2(P) -> S2(P)` no-op.
- `ensureRecordingEntry(activeDestination)` before activation.
3. `::capture` with resolved destination `D`:
- `S0 -> S2(D)` and pointer set `D`.
- `S1(P) -> S2(D)` and pointer set `D`.
- `S2(P) -> S2(D)` and pointer set `D` (deactivate prior active destination; no explicit close/finalize step required).
- `ensureRecordingEntry(D)` is idempotent (reuse when already allocated).
4. `::stop`:
- `S2(P) -> S1(P)`
- `S0`, `S1(P)` remain unchanged (no-op).
5. `::export`:
- `S0`, `S1(P)`, `S2(P)` unchanged.

## Init Destination Preparation
`::init [abs-path]` should prepare the target so users can infer success without UI.

1. Resolve destination:
- If `<abs-path>` is provided, use it.
- Else if `primaryRecordingDestination` exists, use it.
- Else use generated global default destination.
2. Validate resolved destination and policy gate before mutation.
3. Ensure stable destination identity:
- If `recordings[]` has no entry for destination, allocate one as a pending value.
- If destination entry already exists, reuse its `recordingId` (no new allocation).
4. If file does not exist, create it.
5. For Markdown targets when frontmatter is enabled, write full frontmatter on create using command-time snapshot context:
- `title` from snapshot title resolver.
- `sessionId` from provider session metadata.
- `participants` and `conversationEventKinds` derived from snapshot events up to init boundary.
- `created`/`updated` timestamps from init execution time.
- `recordingIds` includes the stable destination `recordingId`.
6. For non-Markdown targets, create empty file.
7. If file already exists, leave content unchanged (idempotent no-op for content).
8. Persist `primaryRecordingDestination` only after file preparation succeeds:
- Missing file: pointer commit happens only if create succeeds.
- Existing file: pointer commit happens only after validation succeeds.
9. Commit pending/new destination recording entry only with the same successful pointer commit.

## In-Message Sequential Execution and Boundaries
Commands inside one `message.user` are processed in source order using parsed line numbers.

1. Parse command lines with stable order.
2. Execute commands sequentially in that order.
3. Define per-command boundary slices:
- Snapshot boundary for `capture` and `export`: all conversation up to and including command boundary.
- Start boundary for `record` in inactive state: do not include content before the `::record` line.
4. `record` in inactive state with trailing text in same message:
- Seed append includes the `::record` command line itself plus text until the next command line (or message end).
- This gives in-message granularity without recording earlier lines from same message.
5. If `record` is no-op in `S2`, it does not reseed any same-message content.

## Failure and Atomicity Rules
1. `init` failure leaves pointer unchanged.
2. `init` failure leaves destination recording registry unchanged.
3. `record` failure leaves pointer unchanged.
4. `capture` failure leaves pointer and active state unchanged.
5. `capture` failure leaves destination recording registry unchanged if allocation/write fails before commit.
6. `export` failure leaves pointer and active state unchanged.
7. Sequential execution is not transactional across commands in one message:
- Earlier successful commands persist even if a later command fails.

## Implementation Plan
1. Update parser in [command_detection.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/policy/command_detection.ts):
- Add `init` command support and include it in `InChatControlCommandName`.
- Remove `start` support and remove it from `InChatControlCommandName`.
- Enforce `record` has no argument.
- Enforce `stop` has no argument.
- Keep `capture` optional argument.
- Keep `export` required argument.
2. Refactor command execution in [daemon_runtime.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/daemon_runtime.ts):
- Remove `record -> start` alias.
- Add `init` command branch with prepare-file behavior.
- Add explicit composite-state transition handling (`S0`, `S1`, `S2`) including deactivate-on-init and deactivate-on-capture behavior.
- Add no-op path for `record` in active state.
- Add command-boundary slicing for same-message execution.
- Reuse `commandCursor` as the only command-processing cursor (no additional cursor field).
3. Add runtime helpers:
- `resolvePrimaryDestination(...)` to return pointer or generated global default.
- `setPrimaryDestination(...)` and pointer normalization.
- `getOrCreateDestinationRecording(...)` to allocate/reuse one `recordings[]` entry per destination.
- `prepareInitDestination(...)` to create file/stub safely.
- `resolveCommandBoundaries(...)` and segment extraction for same-message granularity.
4. Extend metadata contract in [session_state.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/shared/src/contracts/session_state.ts):
- Add `primaryRecordingDestination?: string`.
- Keep `recordings[]` as-is structurally; enforce one-entry-per-destination invariant in runtime logic.
- Keep schemaVersion unchanged (`SESSION_METADATA_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1`) for this additive optional-field change.
5. Persist pointer in [session_state_store.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/orchestrator/session_state_store.ts):
- Clone/read/write support for new fields.
- Update `isSessionMetadataV1` validation for any added field types.
6. Keep path policy gate unchanged in [path_policy.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/apps/daemon/src/policy/path_policy.ts):
- Still gate absolute canonical destination against allowed roots.
7. Update docs:
- Update command semantics in [README.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/README.md).
- Update in-chat command references in [dev.general-guidance.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/documentation/notes/dev.general-guidance.md).

## Tests and Scenarios
1. Update parser tests in [command-detection_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/command-detection_test.ts):
- `::init /abs/a.md` parses.
- `::init` parses.
- `::record` parses.
- `::stop` parses.
- `::start` fails.
- `::record /abs/a.md` fails.
- `::stop id:abc` fails.
2. Update runtime tests in [daemon-runtime_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/tests/daemon-runtime_test.ts):
- `::record` in `S0` generates default destination, persists pointer, starts active.
- `::init /abs/a.md` in inactive state sets pointer and prepares file, active unchanged.
- `::init` in `S0` creates default destination file, sets pointer, and allocates destination ID.
- `::init` with existing pointer and existing file is content no-op.
- `::init` in `S2` deactivates old active recording and transitions to inactive pointer-at-new-destination state.
- Failed `init` leaves pointer unchanged.
- Failed `record` leaves pointer unchanged.
- `::record` in `S1` starts active at pointer.
- `::record` in `S2` is no-op.
- `::stop` in `S2` stops but preserves pointer.
- `::record` after stop resumes pointer destination.
- `::capture /abs/b.md` captures, sets pointer to `/abs/b.md`, and activates there.
- `::capture` no arg captures to pointer if set, otherwise generated default, and activates there.
- Repeated `::init`/`::capture` to same destination reuses the same destination `recordingId`.
- Two different destinations allocate two distinct `recordingId` values.
- `::capture` in `S2` deactivates prior active destination and leaves no orphan active entries.
- Frontmatter on file creation includes the stable destination `recordingId`.
- `::export /abs/e.md` exports snapshot boundary only; pointer and active unchanged.
- Sequential one-message commands execute in order (`::stop`, `::init`, `::record`).
- In-message `::record` granularity excludes lines before command boundary.
- In-message `::record` granularity includes the `::record` command line.
- Relative arg rejection for `init`, `capture`, and `export`.
3. Replace obsolete tests:
- Remove/replace tests that depend on ambiguous `::stop` target matching.
- Remove/replace tests that depend on `::start` command.
- Remove/replace tests that depend on pathful `::record`.
4. Logging assertions:
- Parse errors logged via `recording.command.parse_error`.
- Runtime invalid-target logs include explicit absolute-path reason.
- No-op and state-transition events are logged with deterministic metadata.

## Rollout, Risk, and Compatibility
1. Hard switch in one release.
2. No backward-compat aliases for old in-chat command forms.
3. Primary risk: existing user muscle memory for `::start` and `::record <path>`, plus implicit `::stop <arg>` selectors.
4. Mitigation:
- README command table and examples updated.
- Clear parse error messages indicating replacement forms (`::init [abs-path]`, then `::record`).

## Assumptions and Defaults
1. No active sessions currently depend on multi-active recording behavior.
2. No persisted metadata migration is required for multi-active cleanup.
3. Primary destination pointer is session-scoped and persisted.
4. Global fallback root remains `~/.kato/recordings` (or `.kato/recordings` when home cannot be resolved).
5. Destination identity is canonical-path-scoped and persisted as one `recordingId` per path via `recordings[]`.
6. No cleanup/GC policy for inactive destination entries in `recordings[]` in this phase.
